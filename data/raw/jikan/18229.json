These existential threats, called MESS, are becoming increasingly dangerous, destroying everything they touch. Now it's up to the Gatchaman and their new recruit to stop them before the world is engulfed in chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "The North American release of the Gatchaman Crowds anime series does not contain the director's cut of episode 12, which remains exclusive to Japan.", "season": "summer", "year": 2013, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Saturdays at Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "VAP", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 1003, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Television Network", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"}, {"mal_id": 3193, "type": "anime", "name": "Sound Inn Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3193/Sound_Inn_Studio"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 103, "type": "anime", "name": "Tatsunoko Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 30925, "type": "anime", "name": "Gatchaman Crowds Insight: Inbound", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30925/Gatchaman_Crowds_Insight__Inbound"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 23703, "type": "anime", "name": "Gatchaman Crowds: Embrace", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/23703/Gatchaman_Crowds__Embrace"}]}, {"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 2389, "type": "anime", "name": "Kagaku Ninja-tai Gatchaman", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2389/Kagaku_Ninja-tai_Gatchaman"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Crowds\" by WHITE ASH"], "endings": ["\"INNOCENT NOTE\" by Hajime Ichinose (CV: Maaya Uchida)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.ntv.co.jp/GATCHAMAN_Crowds/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=9820"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=15280"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatchaman_Crowds"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%AC%E3%83%83%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3_%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A6%E3%82%BA"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/3047"}], "streaming": [{"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/tv/gatchaman-crowds"}]}}

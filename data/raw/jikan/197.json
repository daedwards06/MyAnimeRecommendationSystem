Furthermore, he learns Rizel is no ordinary girl; she is a biochemically engineered human, and her creators (her \"papa\"s, as they are often referred to) promise to waive multiple bills of Iwaki's parents in exchange to be allowed to stay at their house, and thus Iwaki's life with Rizel begins.", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2002, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "m.o.e.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/40/moe"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}, {"mal_id": 75, "type": "anime", "name": "Imagin", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/75/Imagin"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 501, "type": "manga", "name": "Rizelmine", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/501/Rizelmine"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Hajimete Shimasho!\" by Rie Kugimiya"], "endings": ["1: \"Honki PAWAA no Dasshu!\" by Rie Kugimiya (eps 01-12,24)", "2: \"To My Husband\" by Rie Kugimiya (eps 13-23)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.ponycanyon.co.jp/pc-moe/rizeru/index.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=19"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=841"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rizelmine#Anime"}], "streaming": []}}

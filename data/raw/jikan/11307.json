Space differs from the rest of the Once Upon a Time titles in the sense that the series revolve on a dramatic content rather than an educational premise. The series still has a handful of educational information (such as an episode discussing the rings of Planet Saturn).\n\nThe series succeeds Once Upon a Time... Man. It reprises almost the entire totality of the characters of the previous series and adapts them into a science-fiction context.\n\nThe story tells about the confrontation of many big galactic powers. Among them there is the Omega Confederation, of which Earth is a member of; the military republic of Cassiopée led by the general Le Teigneux; and a powerful supercomputer which controls an army of robots. Once Upon a Time... Space features the adventures of Pierrot (son of colonel Pierre and president Pierrette) and his friend Psi.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 191, "type": "anime", "name": "Eiken", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/191/Eiken"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 3624, "type": "anime", "name": "Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3624/Seimei_no_Kagaku__Micro_Patrol"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["1: \"Ashita no Ginga e (あしたの銀河へ)\" by ピーカブー", "2: \"Ginga no Joou (銀河の女王)\" by Tatsuya Matsuno"], "endings": ["1: \"Ai no Mori (愛の森)\" by ピーカブー", "2: \"Yoake no Prelude (夜明けのプレリュード)\" by Tatsuya Matsuno"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.eiken-anime.jp/works/works031.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5081"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11505"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time..._Space"}], "streaming": []}}

In that life, he loved the miko Ayame, though their love was doomed by war. Now, in this life, he is given a prophecy that he will meet the woman of his dreams.\n\nTakakage, a college student, has been having strange dreams lately. In them, a young shrine priestess named Ayame promises to marry a young, look-alike soldier named Genshiro the night before he is sent to battle. Takakage finds a maiden who looks like the woman from his dreams. With the help of her, his sister, and his fortune-telling friend, he seeks to find the answers of what their, and his, true origins lay.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 206, "type": "anime", "name": "Digital Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/206/Digital_Works"}, {"mal_id": 3172, "type": "anime", "name": "Arts Pro", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3172/Arts_Pro"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 296, "type": "anime", "name": "Critical Mass Video", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/296/Critical_Mass_Video"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 239, "type": "anime", "name": "Y.O.U.C", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/239/YOUC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.vanilla-jp.com/catalog/canpus/re_canpus1.htm"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1301"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=462"}], "streaming": []}}

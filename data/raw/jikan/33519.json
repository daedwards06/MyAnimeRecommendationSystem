At Aragane Station, Ikoma works as a steamsmith to maintain the city's active transportation. Despite his role, he is angered by mankind's cowardice and inability to repel the Kabane.\n\nUtilizing his free time and knowledge as an engineer, Ikoma has created a new weapon to ward off the horde. An opportunity to test it presents itself when the Kabane invade Aragane Station, yet this encounter will prove to be much more than just a trial run for Ikoma.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "During the first week of Japanese theater screenings for Koutetsujou no Kabaneri Movie 1: Tsudou Hikari, audience members were gifted a drama CD titled Hanashi Geki Koutetetsujou no Kabaneri: Shigure no Yume, which features a story that occurs after the TV series.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 858, "type": "anime", "name": "Wit Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/858/Wit_Studio"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 76, "type": "anime", "name": "Survival", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/76/Survival"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 33520, "type": "anime", "name": "Koutetsujou no Kabaneri Movie 2: Moeru Inochi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/33520/Koutetsujou_no_Kabaneri_Movie_2__Moeru_Inochi"}]}, {"relation": "Full Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 28623, "type": "anime", "name": "Koutetsujou no Kabaneri", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/28623/Koutetsujou_no_Kabaneri"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"KABANERI OF THE IRON FORTRESS\" by EGOIST"], "endings": ["\"ninelie \" by SawanoHiroyuki[nZk]:Aimer"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.kabaneri.com/movie/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=12246"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=18964"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabaneri_of_the_Iron_Fortress"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%B2%E9%89%84%E5%9F%8E%E3%81%AE%E3%82%AB%E3%83%90%E3%83%8D%E3%83%AA"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-278554"}]}}

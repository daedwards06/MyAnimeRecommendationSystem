Overseen by the supercomputer Gaia and populated with an extremely large number of Bioroids—genetically engineered people designed to handle all administrative functions—Olympus affords its citizens lives free from all worries. However, a surge of crimes has been occurring within this seemingly utopian environment.\n\nIn order to protect the people, Deunan Knute and her partner Briareos Hecantochires work for Olympus' Enhanced SWAT team, taking on the most violent criminal cases. When a group of terrorists threaten to destroy the Olympians' way of life, Deunan and Briareos swear to take them down—no matter the cost.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "The OVA has an almost completely original storyline, only sharing some of the characters and the setting with the source material.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 577, "type": "anime", "name": "Tohokushinsha Film Corporation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/577/Tohokushinsha_Film_Corporation"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}, {"mal_id": 947, "type": "anime", "name": "Manga Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Gainax", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/6/Gainax"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 668, "type": "manga", "name": "Appleseed", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/668/Appleseed"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 54, "type": "anime", "name": "Appleseed (Movie)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/54/Appleseed_Movie"}, {"mal_id": 22677, "type": "anime", "name": "Appleseed Alpha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/22677/Appleseed_Alpha"}]}, {"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 9737, "type": "anime", "name": "Appleseed XIII", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/9737/Appleseed_XIII"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": ["\"Crystal Celebration\" by Yuuki Risa"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=166"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=512"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appleseed_%28OVA%29"}], "streaming": []}}

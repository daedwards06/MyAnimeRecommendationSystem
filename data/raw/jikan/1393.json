Hayato's longtime friend, Asuka Sugo, helps nurse him back to health, and in return he proposes to her and promises her that he would never race again. But as time goes on, Hayato begins to doubt whether he really wants to retire, and decides to make a comeback after all. And with the 13th Cyber Formula World Grand Prix now underway, he must struggle to regain his racing form; regain the trust of Asuka, whose promise he broke; and thwart the malicious intents of Henri Clayton. All the while, the reason behind Hayato's accident begins to unveil itself: the \"Zero Zone.\"\n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Racing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Prequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1392, "type": "anime", "name": "Future GPX Cyber Formula 11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1392/Future_GPX_Cyber_Formula_11"}]}, {"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1394, "type": "anime", "name": "Future GPX Cyber Formula Saga", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1394/Future_GPX_Cyber_Formula_Saga"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Wind is High\" by Yumi Kinoshita"], "endings": ["1: \"Get Up!\" by Yumi Kinoshita (eps 1-7)", "2: \"Brand New Dream\" by Yumi Kinoshita (eps 8)"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2462"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4230"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_GPX_Cyber_Formula#OVA_series"}], "streaming": []}}

The film depicts a macabre game played by two rabbits and a blindfolded woman. The rabbits face each other over an old-fashioned illustrated board game. When they land on a square, the woman must eat the food indicated in the illustration. If she has chosen correctly, a die pops out of her mouth and lands on the floor giving the rabbits their next move.\n\n(Source: Midnight Eye)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 5, "type": "anime", "name": "Avant Garde", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Avant_Garde"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 59, "type": "anime", "name": "High Stakes Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/59/High_Stakes_Game"}, {"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Strategy Game", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/11/Strategy_Game"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.imageforum.co.jp/new-anime/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=7972"}], "streaming": []}}

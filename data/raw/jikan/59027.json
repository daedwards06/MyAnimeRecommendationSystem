To this end, spy Loid Forger has managed to maintain his pretend family consisting of his telepathic daughter, Anya; assassin wife, Yor; and their clairvoyant dog, Bond. Still the only one aware of everyone's true identities, Anya tries to sustain the family's cohesion while working to befriend Donovan's son Damian, her Eden Academy classmate.\n\nHowever, Anya's efforts instead earn her another Tonitrus Bolt, bringing her closer to getting expelled and jeopardizing the operation's success. Hearing the news, Loid faints from shock. In his unconsciousness, he reminisces about his tragic past and his journey to becoming a spy. Realizing what Operation Strix means to him and the world, Loid finds renewed motivation. Although they each work toward their own covert goals, the Forgers continue to cherish their chaotic yet blissful family life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan-Shueisha Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/62/Shogakukan-Shueisha_Productions"}, {"mal_id": 1143, "type": "anime", "name": "TOHO animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1143/TOHO_animation"}, {"mal_id": 1294, "type": "anime", "name": "Sound Team Don Juan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1294/Sound_Team_Don_Juan"}, {"mal_id": 1365, "type": "anime", "name": "Shueisha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1365/Shueisha"}, {"mal_id": 2229, "type": "anime", "name": "Toho Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2229/Toho_Music"}, {"mal_id": 3210, "type": "anime", "name": "Verygoo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3210/Verygoo"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 858, "type": "anime", "name": "Wit Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/858/Wit_Studio"}, {"mal_id": 1835, "type": "anime", "name": "CloverWorks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1835/CloverWorks"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Childcare", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/53/Childcare"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Prequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 53887, "type": "anime", "name": "Spy x Family Season 2", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/53887/Spy_x_Family_Season_2"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 119161, "type": "manga", "name": "Spy x Family", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/119161/Spy_x_Family"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Hi wo Mamoru (灯を護る)\" by Spitz (スピッツ) (eps 2-)"], "endings": ["1: \"Hi wo Mamoru (灯を護る)\" by Spitz (スピッツ) (eps 1)", "2: \"Actor\" by Lilas Ikuta (幾田りら) (eps 2-)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "https://spy-family.net/tvseries/"}, {"name": "@spyfamily_anime", "url": "https://twitter.com/spyfamily_anime"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=18677"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=32804"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family_season_3"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPY%C3%97FAMILY_(%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1)#%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/7573"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/G4PH0WXVJ"}, {"name": "Bilibili Global", "url": "https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"}, {"name": "Muse Asia", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGbshtvS9t-8CW11W7TooQg"}, {"name": "iQIYI", "url": "https://www.iq.com/"}]}}

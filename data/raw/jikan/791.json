Their lives are peaceful until the day Arion's uncle Hades appears and lures him to the underworld, promising that there is a way to restore his mother's sight. To achieve this, Arion must kill the god who cursed her: Zeus, the king of Olympus.\n\nAfter years of training in the underworld, Arion—now a deadly warrior—embarks on his vengeful quest to slay Zeus. On his journey to Mount Olympus, Arion forges alliances with some unlikely individuals: the giant Geedo, the thief Seneca, and the mute maiden Resphoina. As he cuts a bloody path through a vast world of warring armies and mythical monsters, Arion begins to unravel the secrets of his lineage and the fate of the scheming gods.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 382, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokuma Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/382/Tokuma_Shoten"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 23777, "type": "manga", "name": "Arion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/23777/Arion"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": ["\"Pegasus no Shoujo (ペガサスの少女)\" by Kyouko Gotou"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "www.sunrise-anime.jp/sunrise-inc/works/detail.php?cid=121"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=398"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=807"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arion_%28manga%29"}], "streaming": []}}

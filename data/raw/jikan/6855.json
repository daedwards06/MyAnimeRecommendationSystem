One day, Wukong accidentally breaks a sword while training with his companions. To find a more suitable weapon for himself, Wukong travels to the Dragon King's palace, where he obtains a powerful staff.\n\nAngered by Wukong's casual theft of his most precious treasure, the Dragon King goes to the Jade Emperor's palace in Heaven to demand retribution. The Jade Emperor hatches a plan to control the devilish monkey—however, Wukong may not be as easy to fool as the monarch thinks.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Da Nao Tiangong is the first feature-length cel-animated film by the Shanghai Animation Film Studio. The movie was awarded internationally and domestically at the 1978 International London Film Festival, the 1962 Czech Republic Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, and the 1993 Hundred Flowers Film Festival.\n \n The film was originally completed in two parts in 1961 and 1964, respectively. The film was presented as a whole for the first time in 1965.\n \n In 2012 the film was restored as well as being converted to 3D. The film's aspect ratio was changed from 1.33 to 1.78 by adding additional art to the backgrounds and at times moving the character placement within the frame. The film was shortened to 90 minutes by \"speed[ing] up some of the action scenes.\" The score and dialogue were re-recorded for a new Dolby 5.1 and 7.1 mix.

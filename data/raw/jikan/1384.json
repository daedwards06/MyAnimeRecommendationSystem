However, Miyu Yamano is exactly that, as well as being a guardian between the dark realm of the Shinma and the human world. As creatures with godlike demonic power, Shinma terrorize innocent people, and one in particular has been masquerading as a member of the noble vampire race. As Himiko continues her investigation, she has trouble believing that Miyu is truly innocent, and fails to understand why a vampire would protect humans from Shinma.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 1372, "type": "anime", "name": "Soeishinsha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1372/Soeishinsha"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 310, "type": "anime", "name": "AnimEigo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/310/AnimEigo"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}, {"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Vampire", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 4542, "type": "manga", "name": "Shin Vampire Miyu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/4542/Shin_Vampire_Miyu"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 690, "type": "anime", "name": "Kyuuketsuhime Miyu (TV)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/690/Kyuuketsuhime_Miyu_TV"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.ponycanyon.co.jp/intl/tp_new/animation/vampiremiyuOVA.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=172"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=92"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Princess_Miyu"}], "streaming": []}}

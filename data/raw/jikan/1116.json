With her parents frequently absent due to work, one of her only companions is her talking dog, Junkers.

Given the potential of this newfound power, Hiromi must wish carefully—as obtaining what she thinks she wants may end up hurting those she cares about most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Junkers Come Here won the Best Animation Film award at the Mainichi Film Awards in 1995.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 113, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 110, "type": "anime", "name": "Triangle Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/110/Triangle_Staff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 46, "type": "anime", "name": "Award Winning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/46/Award_Winning"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 42228, "type": "anime", "name": "Junkers Come Here Pilot Film", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/42228/Junkers_Come_Here_Pilot_Film"}]}, {"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 19627, "type": "anime", "name": "Junkers Come Here: Memories of You", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/19627/Junkers_Come_Here__Memories_of_You"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Real You, Another You\" by Naoto Kine"], "endings": ["\"Winter Comes Around\" by Akiko Hioki"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1325"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1090"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junkers_Come_Here"}], "streaming": []}}

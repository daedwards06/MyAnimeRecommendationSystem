Their mission is to retrieve the Throne of Yord, a magical artifact that is the source of Guardian World's power and has to be returned before it falls into the wrong hands.\n\nWhile tracking the artifact, Tiara encounters her old friend Lena, another sorceress seeking the Throne of Yord. Tiara's situation is further complicated by the appearance of Kagetsu, a man she once held strong feelings for. Kagetsu is a negater—a person with the ability to neutralize magic—and holds a close link to the Throne of Yord. Torn between the loyalty to her mission and the bonds with her friends, Tiara embarks on a difficult journey filled with unforeseen challenges.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 155, "type": "anime", "name": "animate Film", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/155/animate_Film"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 250, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Blasters", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}, {"mal_id": 284, "type": "anime", "name": "Central Park Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 110, "type": "anime", "name": "Triangle Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/110/Triangle_Staff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 5466, "type": "anime", "name": "Mahoutsukai Tai! vs. Shamanic Princess", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5466/Mahoutsukai_Tai_vs_Shamanic_Princess"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Inori no Asa (祈りの朝)\" by Miwako Saitou"], "endings": ["1: \"Omoide no Mori (想い出の森)\" by Miwako Saitou", "2: \"Kaze no Matsuri (風の祭)\" by Wuyontana"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.shamanicprincess.com/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=310"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=730"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamanic_Princess"}], "streaming": []}}

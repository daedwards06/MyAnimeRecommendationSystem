Shinjuro Tateoka is the unassuming son of a notable dojo's leader. When his father Tessyusai is suddenly sent on a mission by the shogunate, the dojo's management falls into Shinjuro's hands. After losing most of its regular students, the dojo welcomes several young girls into its walls.\n\nDespite the changes, life at the swordsmanship school is surprisingly peaceful—until the shogunate calls upon all prominent dojos to patrol the city following a slew of burglaries. Now facing a group of cunning thieves who seem to have greater aims than just stealing a few treasures, Shinjuro struggles to find a balance between his exciting life with beautiful women and the needs of the government.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Kaitouranma The Animation is an adaptation of the 1999 PlayStation video game Kaitouranma Miyabi by Imagineer Co., Ltd.

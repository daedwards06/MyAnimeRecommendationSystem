The plan worked and almost every village member ran up as the rice crops were their only livelihood. The tsunami came and the whole villages below were destroyed thus saving the villagers from death.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 198, "type": "anime", "name": "Gakken", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/198/Gakken"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 39378, "type": "anime", "name": "Inamura no Hi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39378/Inamura_no_Hi"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.gakken-eizo.com/goods/animation/6200003140.html"}], "streaming": []}}

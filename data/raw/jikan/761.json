Despite the unique clover being located in a forbidden area, there is nothing stopping the two from bravely embarking on a perilous adventure to achieve their goal.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Naruto: Akaki Yotsuba no Clover wo Sagase is the original series' first OVA that, along with Naruto: Takigakure no Shitou - Ore ga Eiyuu Dattebayo!, was shown exclusively at the annual Shonen Jump Festival in Japan.

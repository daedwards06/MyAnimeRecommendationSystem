However, a counteroffensive is launched.

However, peace is shattered when the EMPIRE begins to use forbidden magic. These dark powers cause dimensional rifts around the world and once again plunge Earth into chaos and warfare.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 116, "type": "anime", "name": "Broccoli", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/116/Broccoli"}, {"mal_id": 3098, "type": "anime", "name": "Aquatone", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3098/Aquatone"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 1474, "type": "anime", "name": "Synch-Point", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1474/Synch-Point"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Prequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1224, "type": "anime", "name": "Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1224/Aquarian_Age__Sign_for_Evolution"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Change My Heart (Qwerty Mix)\" by Yoko Takahashi"], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2456"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3427"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A2%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A8%E3%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%82%A8%E3%82%A4%E3%82%B8"}], "streaming": []}}

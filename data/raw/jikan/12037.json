Richard Kimble is now a veterinarian on the lam (lamb?), running from a false conviction for a murder committed by \"a man with overbite.\" Despite the omnipresent danger, he must stoop and intervene whenever he sees a cat (always Michael) suffering; after treating the patient, he plays a trick on the cat and runs away. (He's a fugitive, after all.) Another sketch draws parallels between wandering husbands and wandering house cats, who seem to have similar proclivities. Two more point out what happens when a cat's instincts run up against the requirements of baseball or pro wrestling.\n\n(Source: Orphan Fansubs)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 99, "type": "anime", "name": "Kitty Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/99/Kitty_Films"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2256, "type": "anime", "name": "Kitty Film Mitaka Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2256/Kitty_Film_Mitaka_Studio"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 71, "type": "anime", "name": "Pets", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/71/Pets"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 3160, "type": "manga", "name": "What's Michael?", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/3160/Whats_Michael"}]}, {"relation": "Character", "entry": [{"mal_id": 12005, "type": "anime", "name": "What's Michael?", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/12005/Whats_Michael"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": ["\"Call My Name (コールマイネーム)\" by Shouko Minami"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5952"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3337"}], "streaming": []}}

An Umbrella scientist lost in all the confusion. The UBCS team, consisting of members Rodrigo, Roger, Klaus, Ed and Norman, have a GPS device used to track down Dr. Cameron’s last known location, which is near a large food factory. \n\nUpon entering the factory they are attacked by a large creature, a sort of hybrid between a Tyrant and the more evolved forms of Nemesis. \n\n(Source: rehorror.net)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 240, "type": "anime", "name": "Capcom", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/240/Capcom"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 8278, "type": "anime", "name": "Biohazard 4: Incubate", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/8278/Biohazard_4__Incubate"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.rehorror.net/thirdeye06/m_4d.php"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=6293"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biohazard_4D-Executer"}], "streaming": []}}

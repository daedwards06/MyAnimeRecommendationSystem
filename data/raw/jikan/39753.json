But while heading home, the timid girl brightens up when she encounters a boy who looks exactly like her first love—a prince from a shoujo manga. Subsequently, she finds herself in a peculiar situation with the mature Akari Yamamoto, a new neighbor who immediately befriends her.\n\nNow attending the same high school together, Yuna shows interest in Akari's brother Rio—the same mysterious and handsome boy she met during spring break. Likewise, Akari is falling for Yuna's carefree childhood friend, Kazuomi Inui. However, love is not at anyone's fingertips, as the relationship between these four contrasting friends faces complications, preventing them from moving forward. To discover the truth between them, they will need to confront their own struggles and uncover secrets hidden among themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Omoi, Omoware, Furi, Furare was originally slated to premiere on May 29, 2020, but was delayed to September 18, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

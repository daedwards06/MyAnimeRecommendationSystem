The commercial's song was so popular people were requesting the commercial to air instead of regular songs. NHK eventually purchased the rights to feature and have a music video created for a cleaned up version of the song (a significant portion of the lyrics were changed). This was a rare instance as it is one of the few Minna no Uta songs that came from private broadcasters as almost all are created from public broadcasters such as NHK themselves.\n\nThe remade version was still a popular hit and was featured on the Minna no Uta program for 4 months straight.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 111, "type": "anime", "name": "NHK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www2.nhk.or.jp/minna/search/index.cgi?id=MIN199306_01"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BB%A5%E5%BF%83%E4%BC%9D%E5%BF%83%E3%81%97%E3%82%88%E3%81%86"}], "streaming": []}}

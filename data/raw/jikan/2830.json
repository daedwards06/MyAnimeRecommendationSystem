It has musical numbers typical this era of Toei films, some awkward slapstic, plenty of scenes tailored to pull on the heartstrings, and very smooth animation. Overall a pleasant film that's interesting to watch for the technical aspects; but the story leaves much to be desired, being on the melodramatic-maudlin side. The later Dezaki/Sugino version is very different, with 52 episodes for the story to breathe in and far more compelling storytelling.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 2828, "type": "anime", "name": "Ie Naki Ko", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2828/Ie_Naki_Ko"}, {"mal_id": 2829, "type": "anime", "name": "Ie Naki Ko Remy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2829/Ie_Naki_Ko_Remy"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Remi no Uta (レミのうた)\" by Fontain Harmony (フォンテーヌ・ハーモニー)"], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/lineup/movie/movie_remi/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2212"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3567"}], "streaming": []}}

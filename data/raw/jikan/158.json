She has a deep aversion to men and is revolted by the idea of having to dance with a male student for the upcoming school play. Desiring to step down from her role, she proposes to the Yamayuri Council, Lillian's student council, that she will instead prove her worth by finding a petite sœur—an underclassman who becomes the protegee of her grande sœur.\n\nTo the bewilderment of all, Yumi Fukuzawa, the first-year student Sachiko invites to become her petite sœur, refuses the proposal. However, senior Yamayuri Council member Sei Satou proposes a challenge: if Sachiko can convince Yumi to become her petite sœur, she can withdraw from the play. Although Sachiko often struggles to connect with others, she endeavors to do everything in her power to win Yumi over.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Maria-sama ga Miteru was released on Blu-ray in North America by Maiden Japan on March 24, 2020.", "season": "winter", "year": 2004, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "01:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 01:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 160, "type": "anime", "name": "Rondo Robe", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/160/Rondo_Robe"}, {"mal_id": 717, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/717/TV_Tokyo_Music"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 217, "type": "anime", "name": "Nozomi Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 490, "type": "anime", "name": "Maiden Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Deen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 26, "type": "anime", "name": "Girls Love", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/26/Girls_Love"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 444, "type": "anime", "name": "Maria-sama ga Miteru: Haru", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/444/Maria-sama_ga_Miteru__Haru"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1227, "type": "manga", "name": "Maria-sama ga Miteru", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1227/Maria-sama_ga_Miteru"}, {"mal_id": 4177, "type": "manga", "name": "Maria-sama ga Miteru", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/4177/Maria-sama_ga_Miteru"}]}, {"relation": "Side Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 3468, "type": "anime", "name": "Maria-sama ga Miteru Specials", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3468/Maria-sama_ga_Miteru_Specials"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"pastel pure\" by Mikiya Katakura"], "endings": ["\"Sonata Blue\" by Mikiya Katakura"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1297"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3150"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria-sama_ga_Miteru"}], "streaming": [{"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/tv/maria-watches-over-us"}]}}

Shinn believes Athrun to be a traitor, an obstacle in the course of the universe's peaceful future.\n\nAs life-or-death mobile suit brawls are waged for the fate of the galaxy, a sprawling war between humans who are incapable of understanding one another draws to its conclusion.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "This episode expands on the last episode of the original Kidou Senshi Gundam SEED Destiny series.

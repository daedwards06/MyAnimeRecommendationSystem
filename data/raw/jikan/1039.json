Moreover, her body is transparent, and she looks like the ghost. Her name is Hiyori. She is a friend in their childhood. They are pleased with reunion though Kenji and Yuki are perplexed with the way of Hiyori's strange appearance. However, Yuki gets the mind shaken as Kenji and Hiyori become intimate, and the pain in her mind in the childhood is recalled. \n\nAt the childhood, Yuki was going to pass the light blue toy ring which Kenji had had to Hiyori in exchange for Hiyori's yoyo.

Their events in the childhood seem to be related to Hiyori's showing up in front of them. \nA painful love story of Kenji and two girls progresses. \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1446, "type": "anime", "name": "NEC Avenue", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1446/NEC_Avenue"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "OLM", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 72335, "type": "manga", "name": "Mizuiro", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/72335/Mizuiro"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1038, "type": "anime", "name": "Mizuiro", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1038/Mizuiro"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Sora no Tsuzuki (空のつづき)\" by Hiromi Sato"], "endings": ["\"Yasashisa no Hajimaru Basho (やさしさの始まる場所)\" by Hiromi Sato"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.animate.tv/pv/detail.php?id=p000000039"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=752"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2162"}], "streaming": []}}

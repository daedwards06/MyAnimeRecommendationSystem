Under the pseudonym \"Ai,\" she uploads videos of her performances—during which she cross-dresses—to the platform Smile Douga. Despite gaining significant popularity, Ai remains focused on her goal of one day besting her idol, \"dance prince\" Hayate.\n\nAi's dance skills soon catch Hayate's attention, though he remains unaware that she is a girl. After the two participate in the same audition, they end up in an idol group called Buddyz and join an all-male dance competition. To make things even more complicated, as Ai and Hayate's rivalry heats up, so do Hayate's romantic feelings toward Ai's female self.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 81, "type": "anime", "name": "Crossdressing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/81/Crossdressing"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 34173, "type": "anime", "name": "Buddy Go! 2", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/34173/Buddy_Go_2"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 89266, "type": "manga", "name": "Buddy Go!", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/89266/Buddy_Go"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://ribon.shueisha.co.jp/ohasta/index.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=12049"}], "streaming": []}}

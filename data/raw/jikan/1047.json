Upon evaluating the casualties, two officers discover a winged girl lying unconscious in chains and attempt to resuscitate her. However, she barely awakens before a group of specialists wearing protective suits hastily takes her away.\n\nDisappointed to see the angel-like being end up in confinement again, the policemen resolve to set her free and start making the necessary preparations. Despite the need to infiltrate a restricted research facility, there is no stopping the duo from readily throwing themselves into a deadly rescue mission.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "On Your Mark is a music video created by Hayao Miyazaki for the pop music duo Chage and Aska, which he worked on as a side project during his production of Mononoke Hime. It is the director's first work combining digital and hand-drawn animation. Originally aired as part of the duo's SUPER BEST3 MISSION IMPOSSIBLE tour in June 1995, the video was later shown alongside screenings of Mimi wo Sumaseba in theaters. It was also presented at the Mononoke Hime screening event in the US—which commemorated the 20th anniversary of the film's release—in 2017. The video was made available on VHS and Laserdisc by Pony Canyon on July 25, 1997. It was later included in the Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short compilation DVD, released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on November 16, 2005. Following the scandal of Aska being arrested for drug possession, Walt Disney Studios Japan removed On Your Mark from the Blu-ray and DVD box sets containing Hayao Miyazaki's works, which were released in July 2014, and also stopped the distribution of Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short. Studio Ghibli eventually decided to offer free individual Blu-rays of On Your Mark to all customers that had acquired box sets between October 2014 and October 2015. On Your Mark was later included in the expanded Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short 1992-2016 Blu-ray and DVD collections, made available by Walt Disney Japan Company on July 17, 2019.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Ghibli", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "https://www.ghibli.jp/works/onyourmark/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=754"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=879"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Your_Mark"}], "streaming": []}}

Dramas that emerge from life's human crossroads... Ordinary people muddling through life and intersect with one another in random ways. Like people walking along road crossings in different directions with no apparent destination in sight.\n\nHuman Crossing is a realistic portrayal of everyday people in modern Japan with all its beauty and ugliness. Human Crossing examines the lives of a boxer whose dark past is rekindled by his estranged mother in \"The Wound\", an idealistic lawyer who fights for an underprivileged young mother in \"The 25th Hour\", a workaholic businessman who rediscovers what's most important in life in \"A Promise\", and an independent woman who reunites with her deadbeat father in \"Direction.\"\n\nHuman Crossing is a collection of vignettes about hope, a reminder of the small victories one can achieve amid the vicissitudes of life. \n\n(Source: Geneon, edited)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2003, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "00:55", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:55 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 67, "type": "anime", "name": "OB Planning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/67/OB_Planning"}, {"mal_id": 3087, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3087/Shogakukan_Productions"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 490, "type": "anime", "name": "Maiden Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 179, "type": "anime", "name": "A.C.G.T.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/179/ACGT"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 27953, "type": "manga", "name": "Human Scramble", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/27953/Human_Scramble"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"REVENGE ~Asu e no Chigai~\" by Nana Katase"], "endings": ["\"Believing\" by Aki Asahina"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.obkikaku.com/human/index.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=656"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2978"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Crossing"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%BA%E9%96%93%E4%BA%A4%E5%B7%AE%E7%82%B9"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/40"}, {"name": "Bangumi", "url": "https://bangumi.tv/subject/5964"}, {"name": "Douban", "url": "https://movie.douban.com/subject/3672650/"}], "streaming": [{"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/tv/human-crossing"}]}}

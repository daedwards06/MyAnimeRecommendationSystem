His dominion remained unchecked for years—until one day, the blind prophet Kuyou prophesied that warriors known as the Six Stars and a child of the vanished race called Ashura would defeat Taishaku-ten. \n\nAshura, marked by his pointed ears and golden eyes; Yasha-ou, a robust warrior; and four other Stars prepare to challenge Taishaku-ten. In order to do so, they must journey across tarnished landscapes and battle monstrous demons that have plagued the land. But as the wheels of fate turn, Ashura and Yasha-ou must find the sixth Star before it is too late. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "KSS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/50/KSS"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 757, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 284, "type": "anime", "name": "Central Park Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 155, "type": "anime", "name": "animate Film", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/155/animate_Film"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 500, "type": "manga", "name": "RG Veda", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/500/RG_Veda"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=465"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=69"}], "streaming": []}}

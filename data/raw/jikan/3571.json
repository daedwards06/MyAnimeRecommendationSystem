However, in a test driving made prior to its completion, he was involved in an accident and judged as dead. Meanwhile his father Daisuke who was watching the test driving all the way recovered the wrecked car as his son`s memento. A few years later the damaged car rebuilt by him revives as the new Mach which comes to participate in Grand Prix. This time, however, for the purpose to protect the driver from a possible accident, the new car is equipped with a safety system called \"Safety Seven\" with seven guarding devices. Also, it is loaded with the engine \"X\" that miraculously survived the tragic accident. Now its driver is Go, younger brother of Kenichi, who is determined to succeed to his brother`s will. In fact, he successfully participates in Grand Prix and keeps growing up to be a top racer of the world.\n\n(Source: official site)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 1997, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 127, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiko Advertising", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 103, "type": "anime", "name": "Tatsunoko Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Racing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 7546, "type": "manga", "name": "Mach GoGoGo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/7546/Mach_GoGoGo"}]}, {"relation": "Spin-Off", "entry": [{"mal_id": 4905, "type": "anime", "name": "Mach Girl", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4905/Mach_Girl"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1445, "type": "anime", "name": "Mach GoGoGo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1445/Mach_GoGoGo"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["1: \"Junpaku no Energy (純白の勇気（エナジー）)\" by Kentarou Hayami", "2: \"Mach GoGoGo 1997 (マッハゴー・ゴー・ゴー1997)\" by Kentarou Hayami"], "endings": ["1: \"FLY TO THE DREAM\" by Youko Kubota", "2: \"Eien no Densetsu (永遠の伝説)\" by Youko Kubota"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.tatsunoko.co.jp/works/archive/machgogogo_1997.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1788"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1445"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Racer"}], "streaming": []}}

Her father had fallen in love with a red dragon he intended to kill, and instead of slaying the dragon, he married her. Their union gave birth to Mink, who inherited horns, a tail, retractable wings, and incredible strength—characteristics which signify her dragon half nature. \n\nMink spends her days accompanied by her friend Pia, a dwarf girl with overprotective parents, and her best friend Lufa, an elf with great healing powers but impressively bad magic. The three find themselves mooning over the dreamy and charming dragonslayer, Dick Saucer. But in a sudden, absurd turn of events, Mink gets closer than ever to the object of her fantasies, only to realize that her love may never be reciprocated because of her dragon heritage.\n\nThus, the trio sets out on a quest to find a potion that will make Mink fully human. They may unwittingly make enemies, but they are sure to have one heck of a good time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Dragon Half is a two-episode original video animation consisting of Dragon Half: Mink's Journey and Dragon Half (Final): The Brutal Killer Martial Arts Tournament, adapting the first two volumes of the manga and released two months apart. Four episodes were planned, but the anime did not garner enough interest to justify a continued production. Dragon Half spawned a videogame of the same name for the TurboGraphx-16 console, or the PC Engine. The game utilizes the storyline of the anime. The voice actors from the anime reprise their roles in the game. The show received an English dubbing, of which ADV Films released on VHS in 2000, and then on DVD that same year. As of March 2014, Discotek Media licensed the franchise.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 113, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 123, "type": "anime", "name": "Victor Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/123/Victor_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 469, "type": "anime", "name": "ING", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/469/ING"}, {"mal_id": 3172, "type": "anime", "name": "Arts Pro", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3172/Arts_Pro"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 20, "type": "anime", "name": "Parody", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 3239, "type": "manga", "name": "Dragon Half", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/3239/Dragon_Half"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Taosu zo!

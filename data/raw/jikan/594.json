As their teacher Kakashi Hatake had departed for Konohagakure beforehand, the team is left to deal with the attacking forces on their own. \n\nWhile the group prepares for a rescue operation, they learn that Suien, the mastermind behind the assault, is pursuing the Hero Water—an elixir that briefly increases the chakra of those who drink it by tenfold. Knowing that the liquid is in Shibuki's possession, Suien takes the villagers hostage to use them as a bargaining chip. \n\nDespite the odds stacked against them, Naruto fights the enemy heroically, spurring Shibuki on to discover the courage to protect his people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Naruto: Takigakure no Shitou - Ore ga Eiyuu Dattebayo! is the first series' second OVA set in between the \"Prologue—Land Of Waves\" and \"Chunin Exams\" arcs, or from episodes 19 to 20 respectively.

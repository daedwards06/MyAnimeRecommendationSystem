Kuroo Hazama is a reserved young man with unusual black-and-white hair, a body covered with scars, and a dark past. Despite only being a medical student, his surgical brilliance starts to attract attention after he completes a seemingly impossible operation. Together with the spirited and honest intern Maiko Okamoto and Yabu, a close friend with a troubled life, Hazama devotes himself to the world of medicine. \n\nHowever, his path to becoming a respectable surgeon is a difficult one as student riots, war, and corruption are consuming Japan. Hazama quickly finds himself caught up in a series of nefarious circumstances that challenge his integrity as a person and his path towards becoming a surgeon. Young Black Jack chronicles the story of a man capable of performing unthinkable feats of medicine, and the journey that leads him to become the legend known as Black Jack.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2015, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "02:16", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 02:16 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}, {"mal_id": 1254, "type": "anime", "name": "Grooove", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1254/Grooove"}, {"mal_id": 1285, "type": "anime", "name": "Being", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1285/Being"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 200, "type": "anime", "name": "Tezuka Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/200/Tezuka_Productions"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 67, "type": "anime", "name": "Medical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/67/Medical"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1520, "type": "anime", "name": "Black Jack", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1520/Black_Jack"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 32429, "type": "manga", "name": "Young Black Jack", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/32429/Young_Black_Jack"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"I am Just Feeling Alive\" by UMI☆KUUN"], "endings": ["\"All Categorize (オールカテゴライズ)\" by Takuto (焚吐)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/ybj/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=11226"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=17057"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Black_Jack"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-267941"}, {"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/tv/young-black-jack"}, {"name": "Animekey", "url": "https://animekey.tv/apps/458/1567291-1608277/8576b39631a16e4d4be20f692e7e7ae6-1619485-1663626/4e83300bef6d68edf8e69dec0e6ae28d-1572525-1614149"}, {"name": "Shahid", "url": "https://shahid.mbc.net/en/series/Young-Black-Jack/series-896041"}]}}

Gokuu happens to be in possession of a dragon ball, but unfortunately for Bulma, he refuses to part ways with it, so she makes him a deal: he can tag along on her journey if he lets her borrow the dragon ball's power. With that, the two set off on the journey of a lifetime.\n\nThey don't go on the journey alone. On the way, they meet the old Muten-Roshi and wannabe disciple Kuririn, with whom Gokuu trains to become a stronger martial artist for the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament. However, it's not all fun and games; the ability to make any wish come true is a powerful one, and there are others who would do much worse than just wishing for a boyfriend. To stop those who would try to abuse the legendary power, they train to become stronger fighters, using their newfound strength to help the people around them along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Adapts the first 194 chapters of Akira Toriyama’s Dragon Ball manga.", "season": "winter", "year": 1986, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/18/Toei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Martial Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 813, "type": "anime", "name": "Dragon Ball Z", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/813/Dragon_Ball_Z"}, {"mal_id": 6033, "type": "anime", "name": "Dragon Ball Kai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/6033/Dragon_Ball_Kai"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "manga", "name": "Dragon Ball", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/42/Dragon_Ball"}]}, {"relation": "Spin-Off", "entry": [{"mal_id": 2520, "type": "anime", "name": "Dragon Ball Specials", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2520/Dragon_Ball_Specials"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 502, "type": "anime", "name": "Dragon Ball Movie 1: Shen Long no Densetsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/502/Dragon_Ball_Movie_1__Shen_Long_no_Densetsu"}, {"mal_id": 891, "type": "anime", "name": "Dragon Ball Movie 2: Majinjou no Nemurihime", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/891/Dragon_Ball_Movie_2__Majinjou_no_Nemurihime"}, {"mal_id": 892, "type": "anime", "name": "Dragon Ball Movie 3: Makafushigi Daibouken", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/892/Dragon_Ball_Movie_3__Makafushigi_Daibouken"}, {"mal_id": 893, "type": "anime", "name": "Dragon Ball Movie 4: Saikyou e no Michi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/893/Dragon_Ball_Movie_4__Saikyou_e_no_Michi"}]}, {"relation": "Character", "entry": [{"mal_id": 2222, "type": "anime", "name": "Dr. Slump: Arale-chan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2222/Dr_Slump__Arale-chan"}, {"mal_id": 30450, "type": "anime", "name": "Dr. Slump: Hoyoyo!

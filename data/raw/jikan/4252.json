Ray's examining an exciting new archeological discovery: a legendary temple located in an isolated area of the world. \n\nAs always, she has with her a strange mirror that belonged to her father; a mirror that may provide access to a vanished civilization. On the excavation, Ray meets Mai and Mami Tachibana, freewheeling pubescent girls who heedlessly court danger. And danger they find, in the form of Rig Veda. \n\nVeda's after a big prize: Ray's mirror. But she will have to stop him at all costs, because if Veda gets his hands on the powerful object, he will possess secrets that could lead to disaster.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 224, "type": "anime", "name": "Toshiba EMI", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/224/Toshiba_EMI"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}, {"mal_id": 155, "type": "anime", "name": "animate Film", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/155/animate_Film"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 29221, "type": "manga", "name": "Explorer Woman Ray", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/29221/Explorer_Woman_Ray"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": ["\"Lights of Love\" by Tamaki Satou (佐藤環)"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2901"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=635"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A8%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A9%E3%83%BC%E3%82%A6%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%83%BB%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4#.E3.82.A2.E3.83.8B.E3.83.A1"}], "streaming": []}}

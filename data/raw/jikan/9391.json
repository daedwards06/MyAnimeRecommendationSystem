Born August 11 1943, he was known as the director of several animations including VIFAM. Thus in 1998 a new TV series of VIFAM was broadcasted in memory of him. Televised 1998/3/21-1998/10/3 (in Kansai area), it contains 26 episodes, and like Twelve people disappeared it is a sidestory, but some new features are added: new persons, new RV, etc.\n\nThe story could be inserted between #22 and #26 (#24 and #25 are digests) of VIFAM, and is divided into three parts: Act I (#1-14), Interlude (#15-18), Act II (#19-26), if we name them (in reality Act I and II have little relationship). It could also be the New Testament, but it is now regarded as an apocrypha (or worse, a pseudo-VIFAM). There are several reasons to say so, but to watch the story is the best way to understand them.\n\n(Source: u-netsurf.ne.jp/~suemura/vifam/vguide.html)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1998, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "02:05", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 02:05 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 2987, "type": "anime", "name": "Ginga Hyouryuu Vifam", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2987/Ginga_Hyouryuu_Vifam"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Omega no Tobira: Hello, Vifam (オメガの扉〜HELLO, VIFAM)\" by Katsumi"], "endings": ["\"Don't cry\" by Ai Maeda and Aki Maeda"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2362"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2001"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginga_Hy%C5%8Dry%C5%AB_Vifam"}], "streaming": []}}

Excited for his new independent life, he hopes to go about his teenage days without the worry of dealing with any strange people, but as he soon discovers, his new boarding house Kawai Complex is far from ordinary.\n\nThe various tenants at Kawai Complex are all quite eccentric characters. Shirosaki, Kazunari's roommate, is a pervert and masochist; Mayumi Nishikino, a borderline alcoholic office lady, hates couples because of her unfortunate luck with men; and Sayaka Watanabe, a seemingly innocent college student, enjoys leading men on. Shocked with the lack of decent individuals at his new residence, Kazunari is about to leave when he runs into shy senior student Ritsu Kawai and finds himself slowly falling in love with her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2014, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "01:16", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 01:16 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 112, "type": "anime", "name": "Brain's Base", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 74, "type": "anime", "name": "Love Status Quo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/74/Love_Status_Quo"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 26769, "type": "manga", "name": "Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/26769/Bokura_wa_Minna_Kawai-sou"}]}, {"relation": "Side Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 24913, "type": "anime", "name": "Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou: Hajimete no", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/24913/Bokura_wa_Minna_Kawai-sou__Hajimete_no"}]}, {"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 24973, "type": "anime", "name": "Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou Specials", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/24973/Bokura_wa_Minna_Kawai-sou_Specials"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Itsuka no, Ikutsuka no Kimi to no Sekai (いつかの、いくつかのきみとのせかい)\" by fhána"], "endings": ["\"My Sweet Shelter\" by Ritsu Kawai (CV: Kana Hanazawa), Mayumi Nishikino (CV: Rina Satou), Sayaka Watanabe (CV: Hisako Kanemoto)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/kawaisou/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=10288"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=15734"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%83%95%E3%82%89%E3%81%AF%E3%81%BF%E3%82%93%E3%81%AA%E6%B2%B3%E5%90%88%E8%8D%98"}], "streaming": [{"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/tv/the-kawai-complex-guide-to-manors-and-hostel-behavior"}]}}

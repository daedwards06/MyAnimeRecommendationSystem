It was never sold in stores and was a special omake by the series' creators to the fans. The OVA contains an epilogue to both series, which is fitting considering they both came out at the same time.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 595, "type": "anime", "name": "NYAV Post", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/595/NYAV_Post"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 110, "type": "anime", "name": "Triangle Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/110/Triangle_Staff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Prequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 629, "type": "anime", "name": "Mahoutsukai Tai!", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/629/Mahoutsukai_Tai"}, {"mal_id": 1182, "type": "anime", "name": "Shamanic Princess", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1182/Shamanic_Princess"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/魔法使いTai!#.E9.AD.94.E6.B3.95.E4.BD.BF.E3.81.84Tai.21_vs_.E3.82.B7.E3.83.A3.E3.83.BC.E3.83.9E.E3.83.8B.E3.83.83.E3.82.AF.E3.83.97.E3.83.AA.E3.83.B3.E3.82.BB.E3.82.B9"}], "streaming": []}}

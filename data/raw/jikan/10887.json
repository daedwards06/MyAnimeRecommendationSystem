Onibaba is an imposing, violent heifer of a woman who regularly berates and even physically assaults her husband and who enjoys nothing more than making his life miserable; Yukiko and Takobo frequently join in physically and psychologically abusing their father. \n\nThe original manga is said to have been quite shocking to early 1970s Japan, in which the father was often still traditionally regarded as the head of the household.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 1974, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 452, "type": "anime", "name": "Knack Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/452/Knack_Productions"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Dame Oyaji no Uta (ダメおやじの唄)\" by Kenbou Kaminarimon, Akira Ooizumi, Sakamoto Jidou Gasshoudan"], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=5493"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1298"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_Oyaji"}], "streaming": []}}

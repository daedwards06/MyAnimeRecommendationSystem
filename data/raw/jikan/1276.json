The beasts are relentless and seemingly have no end to their numbers, while the population of defenders dwindle in every skirmish. Even in the town of Minea, where the people are safely nestled behind castle walls, the constant attacks have left them hopeless. It is then that a prophecy is made, proclaiming the arrival of a brave young soul that could be the one who will bring their salvation.\n\nYs follows Adol Christin, an adventurer driven by wanderlust towards the island of Esteria, who washes up on shore after a shipwreck. Following the guidance of the fortuneteller Sarah Tovah, he and his allies will travel the island in search of the legendary tomes known as the Books of Ys. It will be a long and perilous journey, but if fate is truly at work then Adol will certainly be the hero who returns peace to Esteria.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 92, "type": "anime", "name": "Starchild Records", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/92/Starchild_Records"}, {"mal_id": 468, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Falcom", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/468/Nihon_Falcom"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 250, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Blasters", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 122, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/122/Tokyo_Kids"}, {"mal_id": 1842, "type": "anime", "name": "Urban Product", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1842/Urban_Product"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1277, "type": "anime", "name": "Ys: Tenkuu no Shinden - Adol Christine no Bouken", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1277/Ys__Tenkuu_no_Shinden_-_Adol_Christine_no_Bouken"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 95699, "type": "manga", "name": "Ys", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/95699/Ys"}]}, {"relation": "Character", "entry": [{"mal_id": 23825, "type": "anime", "name": "Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/23825/Ys_IV__The_Dawn_of_Ys"}, {"mal_id": 21427, "type": "anime", "name": "Minna Atsumare!

Like a four leaf clover. Which are said to bring luck even though it is a mutant in the sea of three leaves. And so the curtain rises to glimpse at these four leaf Clovers--4 boys and 3 girls.\n\n(Source: Studio Kaab)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 937, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Kaab", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/937/Studio_Kaab"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.studiokaab.com/project08/clover/01cover.php"}], "streaming": []}}

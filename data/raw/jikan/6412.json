In most ways she is every bit the typical teen—except she doesn't exist.\n\nThe invention of acclaimed computer animator Kenichi Kutsugi, Yuki Terai is Japan's No.1 Virtual Star. Capable of unprecedented life-like expressions and movement, she inhabits many worlds: real-life, science fiction and music. And now she can inhabit yours.\n\nIn Secrets, the multi-faceted Yuki is showcased in six irresistible short stories. In Fly Away Alone, she plays a sensuous songbird; Dos/Chin, which also happens to be the name of her mischievous robotic dog, finds Yuki exploring her artistic side; A Life is a meditative piece where Yuki reflects on happier times; in fully-fledged Matrix mode, Comet The Thief stars our idol as a mischievous martial-arts bandit; The Mirror explores the darker side of Yuki as she is mysteriously followed by images of herself that seem to emerge from mirrors; and in Lazy Gui, our scantily-clad heroine embarks on a race against time as her Space Freighter is set for self-destruct.\n\nIncludes two awesome bonuses: the music video of Yuki's smash hit, My Dearest You, and the incredible World War II air attack recreation, Project BB-11. Additional extras include The Making Of..., which explains the techniques and tricks used to create the state-of-the-art animation that gives life to this virtual megastar.\n\nWelcome to the worlds of Yuki Terai. Enter.. and your world will never be the same. \n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 22561, "type": "anime", "name": "Virtual Star 2000", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/22561/Virtual_Star_2000"}, {"mal_id": 49008, "type": "anime", "name": "Yuki Terai Bonus Track: My Dearest You", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/49008/Yuki_Terai_Bonus_Track__My_Dearest_You"}, {"mal_id": 49009, "type": "anime", "name": "Yuki Terai no Dancing Queen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/49009/Yuki_Terai_no_Dancing_Queen"}, {"mal_id": 53508, "type": "anime", "name": "Yuki Terai in Virtual Hawaii", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/53508/Yuki_Terai_in_Virtual_Hawaii"}, {"mal_id": 50176, "type": "anime", "name": "Cybervenus FeiFei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/50176/Cybervenus_FeiFei"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4629"}], "streaming": []}}

Though born to a wealthy family in Izumozaki, Ryoukan chooses to abandon the easy life he would have inherited in order to understand the true meaning of life through the teachings of Buddhism. From his early adulthood, he undergoes a series of harsh training that demands a solitary and meager lifestyle. Throughout it all, he remains an extremely modest and humble person, a true humanitarian who accepts every individual for who they are while rejecting all worldly fame and wealth. Ryoukan found true peace in life through nature and spending time with children. His pure mind and affable personality have captivated many, and his legacy and the wisdom of his teachings live on today.\n\n(Source: ATTKC)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4115"}], "streaming": []}}

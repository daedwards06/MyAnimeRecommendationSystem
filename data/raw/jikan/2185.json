The two tribes lived in peace and harmony, their domains separated by the “Words Worth” tablet—a huge monolith slab erected by a guardian spirit. Although the tablet has writing on it, neither Tribe can read the text. One day, Words Worth was mysteriously destroyed by an unknown entity; its component parts scattered among the domain of the Tribes of Shadow.\n\nThe two Tribes blamed each other for the tablet’s destruction, and started a war that has been on-going for 100 years.\n\nAstral, prince of the Tribe of Shadow, desires to become a Swordsman of Shadow but his father, King Wortoshika, forbids him to do so. He is engaged to Sharon, a beautiful swordswoman who generally like Astral but wishes he was stronger.\n\n(Source: Urhentai)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 152, "type": "anime", "name": "Green Bunny", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/152/Green_Bunny"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 270, "type": "anime", "name": "NuTech Digital", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/270/NuTech_Digital"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Arms", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/38/Arms"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 203, "type": "anime", "name": "Words Worth", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/203/Words_Worth"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1067"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3367"}], "streaming": []}}

Our hero's way of investigation is so unique and always ends with surprising solutions. The interesting ecology of various insects will be described while our \"cool\" hero, Inspector Fabre, analyzes and unties the knots of crimes and conspiracy a la fashion of Sherlock Holmes!", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2000, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "18:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 18:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 311, "type": "anime", "name": "Enoki Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/311/Enoki_Films"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 154, "type": "anime", "name": "E&G Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/154/E_G_Films"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Mayoeru Tenshi-tachi (迷える天使たち)\" by MELODY"], "endings": ["\"Giniro no Étoile (銀色のエトワール)\" by SUS4"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://egfilms.hp.infoseek.co.jp/fabru.htm"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=4686"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2148"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E5%85%88%E7%94%9F%E3%81%AF%E5%90%8D%E6%8E%A2%E5%81%B5"}], "streaming": []}}

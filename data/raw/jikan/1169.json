The sea, the sky and the land had been completely polluted by mankind when mysterious objects fall from the heavens. These titanic vessels smash into the planet and suck up the air, water, and most living creatures into their womb, stealing away the very essence of Earth`s nature.\n\nThe few remaining inhabitants struggle for survival against a hostile environment and an oppressive ruling race known as the Rodo. One young, hot-blooded human named Ran, fights against the Rodo and a world in which rain is only a legend. He strives to join an Anti-Rodo group known as the Hazzard, not only to defeat the Rodo, but also to hunt down the man who killed his mother.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 204, "type": "anime", "name": "Pioneer LDC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/204/Pioneer_LDC"}, {"mal_id": 3172, "type": "anime", "name": "Arts Pro", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3172/Arts_Pro"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}, {"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": ["\"Tears and Rain\" by Ichirou Mizuki (English Ending song)", "\"Yasashisa Wa Furu Ame No Youni( Tender Like the Falling Rain)\" by Hiroko Kasahara"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=322"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=672"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Legend_Ran"}], "streaming": [{"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/movies/green-legend-ran"}]}}

Alongside the other members, he has spent his days drinking and recklessly having fun. However, when Iori's sister, Shiori, hears about his behavior, she decides to take matters into her own hands—and bring him back home to make him take over their family's inn.\n\nDespite her best efforts, Shiori temporarily gives up as she sees how Iori has grown attached to Grand Blue and his friends. As Iori and the rest of the Diving Club continue to party like there is no tomorrow, they end up in all kinds of bizarrely amusing situations, still somehow managing to hone their scuba diving skills!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "00:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 00:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 1113, "type": "anime", "name": "NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1113/NBCUniversal_Entertainment_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1284, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1284/Avex_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1501, "type": "anime", "name": "JR East Marketing & Communications", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1501/JR_East_Marketing___Communications"}, {"mal_id": 2671, "type": "anime", "name": "Saber Links", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2671/Saber_Links"}, {"mal_id": 2840, "type": "anime", "name": "qooop", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2840/qooop"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1379, "type": "anime", "name": "Zero-G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1379/Zero-G"}, {"mal_id": 2527, "type": "anime", "name": "Liber", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2527/Liber"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 57, "type": "anime", "name": "Gag Humor", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/57/Gag_Humor"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Prequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 37105, "type": "anime", "name": "Grand Blue", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37105/Grand_Blue"}]}, {"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 62542, "type": "anime", "name": "Grand Blue Season 3", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/62542/Grand_Blue_Season_3"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 70345, "type": "manga", "name": "Grand Blue", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/70345/Grand_Blue"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Seishun Towa (青春永遠)\" by Shounan no Kaze (湘南乃風) feat.

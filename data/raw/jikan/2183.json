However, she is devastated when she fails her tryout for All-Japan Pro Wrestling. Seeing her potential, a man under the guise of representing an indie promotion scouts her out. The man who scouted her turns out to be Kunimitsu Tangay, a veteran trainer.\n\nEagerly accepting the invitation, Ayane initially believes she is being trained in strong style wrestling—but is shocked when Kunimitsu signed her up for a kickboxing match instead! With her pride on the line, Ayane pushes through, even though she lacks passion in her newfound sport.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 513, "type": "anime", "name": "Nikkatsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/513/Nikkatsu"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 284, "type": "anime", "name": "Central Park Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 253, "type": "anime", "name": "Rikuentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/253/Rikuentai"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 54, "type": "anime", "name": "Combat Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/54/Combat_Sports"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Fight For Yourself\" by The Street Beats"], "endings": ["\"Aoi Kaze no Mukou ni (蒼い風の向こうに)\" by Yuuko Miyamura"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=997"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=515"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B6%BE%E9%9F%B3%E3%81%A1%E3%82%83%E3%82%93%E3%83%8F%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AD%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF!"}], "streaming": []}}

Now a strong-willed teenager, Lilith has inherited the mysterious Great Sword Calbrinus as well as a mission—to conceive a child with the heir to the Romuald lineage so that one day the Strigoi, Romanian vampires, can rise again. However, the man she must copulate with is Shinta Mizumura, an ordinary Japanese high school student completely unaware of the legacy he carries. While Shinta struggles with his feelings, Lilith strives to accomplish her goal by any means necessary.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Holy Knight was released on Blu-ray in North America by Media Blasters on August 10, 2021.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 609, "type": "anime", "name": "Cammot", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/609/Cammot"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 250, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Blasters", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1759, "type": "anime", "name": "Lyrics", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1759/Lyrics"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Vampire", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 28133, "type": "manga", "name": "Holy Knight", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/28133/Holy_Knight"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Holy Knight\" by Maaya Uchida"], "endings": ["\"Nobodyknows\" by 16th Labo"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://holyknight.cammot.jp/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=8541"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=13225"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Knight"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-265193"}]}}

However, he does not feel as though he belongs anywhere. One day, he finds a book containing instructions on how to make a Rozen Maiden. Mysteriously, when he arrives home that night, the second volume in the book series has been delivered to his house, along with some pieces of a doll. But as suddenly as they started arriving, the books stop coming, and Jun gets a notice that says that the books have ceased being published. With an incomplete doll in hand, and a message from his other self in another world, this Jun also finds his way into the world of the Rozen Maidens.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2013, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "01:58", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 01:58 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Deen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 7728, "type": "manga", "name": "Rozen Maiden (2008)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/7728/Rozen_Maiden_2008"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Rozen Maiden", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/64/Rozen_Maiden"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Watashi no Bara wo Haminasai (私の薔薇を喰みなさい)\" by ALI PROJECT"], "endings": ["\"Alternative\" by Annabel"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/rozen/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=9508"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=15072"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rozen_Maiden"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BC%E3%83%B3%E3%83%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%87%E3%83%B3#%E6%96%B0%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1%E7%89%88"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/3015"}], "streaming": [{"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/tv/rozen-maiden-zurckspulen"}]}}

In opposition to this plan are the slightly nutty Kyuusaku Natsume and Nuku Nuku, the android who acts as a companion to his young son. Nuku Nuku's classmates are all eccentrics, Futaba, the class president, is a domineering control-freak, who cannot leave her authority in school. Chieko Shirakaba is the rich snob with the two yes-girls who always take her side. There is a bookworm, a mystic, a scientist, and a pop singer. All of these are true to their descriptions: the mystic is always foretelling doom via tarot cards, spirits, or some other occult technique. The pop singer never says anything except as a song. The bookworm always has her nose in a book. These eccentricities add to the series' humor. \n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 1998, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "18:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 18:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 127, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiko Advertising", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 242, "type": "anime", "name": "Ashi Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/242/Ashi_Productions"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 76571, "type": "manga", "name": "Shin Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume: Tanjou-hen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/76571/Shin_Bannou_Bunka_Neko-Musume__Tanjou-hen"}]}, {"relation": "Side Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 3232, "type": "anime", "name": "Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume Specials", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3232/Bannou_Bunka_Neko-Musume_Specials"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 373, "type": "anime", "name": "Bannou Bunka Neko-Musume", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/373/Bannou_Bunka_Neko-Musume"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Fine Colorday\" by Megumi Hayashibara"], "endings": ["\"Oyasuminasai Ashita wa Ohayou\" by Megumi Hayashibara"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=526"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=557"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuku_Nuku"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-280750"}]}}

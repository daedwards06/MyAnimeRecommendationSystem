At that time, selected Plusters were combined with humans, and successfully sealed away the evil MINASUTA. It was then believed that the peace which had returned would continue forever. Greenery and trees filled the land, flowers bloomed everywhere, living creatures soar in the blue sky, run on the land, and swim in the seas.\n\nHowever, this peacefulness was once again lost due to reappearance of the MINASUTA... Now, the fusion of Plusters and Humans once again opens the door for a hot adventure! \n\n(Source: aniDB)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2003, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "18:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 18:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 60, "type": "anime", "name": "Actas", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/60/Actas"}, {"mal_id": 112, "type": "anime", "name": "Brain's Base", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/112/Brains_Base"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": ["1: \"Kaze no Kunshou (風の勲章)\" by Seiji Katsu", "2: \"Kaze no Kunshou (Character Version)\" by Yuu Asakawa, Jun Fukuyama", "3: \"Ready for the Time\" by King"], "endings": ["\"One for da Soul\" by Lead"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=585"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2529"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluster_World"}], "streaming": []}}

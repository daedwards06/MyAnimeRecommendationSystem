Koro is a puppy owned by a little girl in a small town. One day she leaves the front gate ajar when she goes to school. Koro slips out and wanders the streets of the town. He is picked up by a girl riding a bicycle, but slips away at the level train crossing. He meets a friendly old dog and his kindly owners, while his mistress and her father ride around town putting up \"Lost\" signs on the power poles. Koro eventually falls asleep under a delivery van, whose driver gives him a ride. When he gets near home, Koro smells the familiar neighborhood and leaps out of the truck and into the arms of his delighted mistress.", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Ghibli", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 71, "type": "anime", "name": "Pets", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/71/Pets"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.ghibli-museum.jp/welcome/cinema/004490.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=3364"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2942"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koro_no_Daisanpo"}], "streaming": []}}

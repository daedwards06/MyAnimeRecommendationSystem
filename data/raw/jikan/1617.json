But if you have forgotten about it, this is a reminder of that fable story. This is the story of a dog that talks, but ordinary people cannot hear his voice.\n\nThe main character, Mametaro, is an adventurous crossbreed dog. He loves his owner, Iku-chan and his girlfriend Hanako-chan very much. However, he just cannot stand Iku-chan's friend, Akiyoshi.\nDuring this story, which will be told from Mametaro's point of view, the warm days of spring are finally here. The school and the riverbank, which is actually just an ordinary neighborhood for people, seems like a mysterious world that extends infinitely to little Mametaro and his friends.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2003, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Not scheduled once per week"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 76, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiuri Telecasting", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/76/Yomiuri_Telecasting"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 96, "type": "anime", "name": "Yumeta Company", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/96/Yumeta_Company"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 71, "type": "anime", "name": "Pets", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/71/Pets"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 43, "type": "anime", "name": "Josei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/43/Josei"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 3182, "type": "anime", "name": "Massugu ni Ikou. 2nd Season", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3182/Massugu_ni_Ikou_2nd_Season"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 48775, "type": "manga", "name": "Massugu ni Ikou.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/48775/Massugu_ni_Ikou"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Dorobou (どろぼう)\" by aiko"], "endings": ["\"Hanabi (花火)\" by aiko"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.ytv.co.jp/massugu03/index_set.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1029"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2931"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/まっすぐにいこう。"}], "streaming": []}}

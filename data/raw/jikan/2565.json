NBC thought that there was no way they could sell that kind of show, and they were quite happy with the 52 episodes they had, so the New Jungle Emperor series wasn`t seen in this country until 1984, when it was given the title Leo The Lion.\n\nThis series was supposed to take place a few years after the original Kimba series. Kimba was an adult, with Kitty as his mate, and they had two cubs. Most of all this series was the story of Rune, the male cub, as he grew and learned to be as strong as his father.\n\nFor legal reasons, the producers of the English-dubbed version could not use the name Kimba, so they used the original Japanese names for all the characters.\n\n(Source: Official Website)", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 1966, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 68, "type": "anime", "name": "Mushi Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/68/Mushi_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Prequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1572, "type": "anime", "name": "Jungle Taitei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1572/Jungle_Taitei"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1771, "type": "manga", "name": "Jungle Taitei", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1771/Jungle_Taitei"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Setting", "entry": [{"mal_id": 2264, "type": "anime", "name": "Jungle Taitei Movie (1997)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2264/Jungle_Taitei_Movie_1997"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["1: \"Jungle Taitei Susume Leo!

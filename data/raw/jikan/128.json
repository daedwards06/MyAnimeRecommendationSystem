A.E.G.I.S is all but dismantled now and has become an underground organization consisting of only a few Gate Keepers left to save humanity. One of the members, Ayane Isuzu, is sick of society as a whole, though she continues to defeat the Invaders out of spite for her father. Suddenly, she learns of the revival of Machine General (Kikai Shogun) and Devil Count (Akuma Hakushaku), but a mysterious ghost girl now accompanies them. It is up to Ayane and the remnants of A.E.G.I.S to stop them and save humanity once again.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Gonzo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Prequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 127, "type": "anime", "name": "Gate Keepers", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/127/Gate_Keepers"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["1: \"Haoto (羽音)\" by Junko Watanabe (eps 1-3)", "2: \"Kyou, Egao ga Areba (今日、笑顔があれば)\" by Sakura Nogawa (eps 4-5)"], "endings": ["1: \"Kyou, Egao ga Areba (今日、笑顔があれば)\" by Sakura Nogawa (eps 1-3,6)", "2: \"Haoto (羽音)\" by Junko Watanabe (eps 4-5)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "https://www.gonzo.co.jp/works/gatekeepers21/index.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=248"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=881"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_Keepers_21"}], "streaming": []}}

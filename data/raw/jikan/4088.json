It involved the adventures of three agents from outer space who were sent to Earth to determine whether the planet, a potential threat to the universe, should be destroyed. The instrument of destruction is a device resembling a large black ball with two antennae that is variously called an anti-proton bomb, a solar bomb, and a neutron bomb. Although the three agents (Captain Bokko, Nokko, and Pukko) are originally humanoid in appearance, upon arrival on Earth they take on the appearances of a rabbit (Bokko), a horse (Nokko), and a duck (Pukko) that they had captured as examples of Earth life forms. While on Earth they travel in a tire-shaped vehicle capable of enormous speeds called the Big Wheel, which can travel on both land and water (and, with modifications, through the air).\n\nThe series tackles a number of issues which were surprisingly progressive for an animated cartoon of that period; particularly ecological concerns and poverty.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 1965, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 68, "type": "anime", "name": "Mushi Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/68/Mushi_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 22300, "type": "manga", "name": "Wonder 3", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/22300/Wonder_3"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 30767, "type": "anime", "name": "Wonder 3 Pilot", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30767/Wonder_3_Pilot"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Wonder 3 (ワンダー3)\" by 小島康男, Vocal Shop, Shinsuke Chikaishi, Fuyumi Shiraishi"], "endings": ["\"Wonder 3 (Instrumental version)\" by Seiichirou Uno (宇野誠一郎)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://en.tezuka.co.jp/anime/sakuhin/ts/ts004.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2876"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=626"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Three"}], "streaming": []}}

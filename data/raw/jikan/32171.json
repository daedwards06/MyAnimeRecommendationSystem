Believing this to be her chance to make a difference, Saya eagerly joins the defense force. There, she meets Amane Ayashiro, another girl from Earth, as well as a selection of fighters from the other worlds. Faced with a formidable foe, the girls must prove that their newfound bonds are strong enough to save the future.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Ange Vierge is based on the trading card game of the same title.

Rescued from certain death by a kindly family, she takes shelter with her adoptive older brother and sister, Shannon and Raquel Casull. When news of her survival reaches the ears of the God Mauser's worshippers, they issue her death at all costs, forcing Pacifica to flee for her life.\n\nPlagued by threats from the church, the nobility and even the common people, the three siblings attempt to outrun the fate Pacifica is destined to bring, all the while questioning if one girl's life is worth the world's demise. The true nature of the Scrapped Princess, along with the harrowing revelations of the world itself, becomes more and more apparent as the princess' 16th birthday fast approaches.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2003, "broadcast": {"day": "Tuesdays", "time": "18:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Tuesdays at 18:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 113, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 171, "type": "anime", "name": "A-Line", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/171/A-Line"}, {"mal_id": 211, "type": "anime", "name": "Rakuonsha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/211/Rakuonsha"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Bones", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 516, "type": "manga", "name": "Scrapped Princess", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/516/Scrapped_Princess"}, {"mal_id": 102260, "type": "manga", "name": "Scrapped Princess", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/102260/Scrapped_Princess"}, {"mal_id": 3864, "type": "manga", "name": "Scrapped Princess", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/3864/Scrapped_Princess"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Little Wing\" by JAM Project featuring Masami Okui"], "endings": ["\"Daichi no la-li-la\" by Yoko Ueno and Masumi Itou"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.sutepri.com/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=640"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2083"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrapped_Princess"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%A9%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%83%89%E3%83%BB%E3%83%97%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B3%E3%82%BB%E3%82%B9#%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/149"}], "streaming": []}}

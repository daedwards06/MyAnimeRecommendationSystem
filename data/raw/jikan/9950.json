However, years pass and a pangolin accidentally drills through the mountains and releases the demons.\n\nAn old man is hiking on the mountains nearby and falls next to a cave where the pangolin escapes from. The pangolin explains the situation and tells the old man the legend of seven calabashes that can save their land from being destroyed. The old man knows what he must do and obtains the legendary calabash plant seed in order to defeat the demons.\n\nAs each calabash matures, it transforms into a child with unique powers.  With a combined effort, these seven calabash brothers set on a mission to defeat the demons in a 13 episode-long adventure.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 471, "type": "anime", "name": "Shanghai Animation Film Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/471/Shanghai_Animation_Film_Studio"}], "genres": [], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 41475, "type": "anime", "name": "Hulu Xiao Jin Gang", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/41475/Hulu_Xiao_Jin_Gang"}, {"mal_id": 43611, "type": "anime", "name": "Xin Hulu Xiongdi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/43611/Xin_Hulu_Xiongdi"}]}, {"relation": "Summary", "entry": [{"mal_id": 43612, "type": "anime", "name": "Hulu Xiongdi (Movie)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/43612/Hulu_Xiongdi_Movie"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=8122"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabash_Brothers"}], "streaming": []}}

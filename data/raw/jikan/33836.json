It is also during this time in life that a mysterious emotion that vexes people of all ages may begin to weigh upon one's mind—love.\n\nAt this point in his teenage years, Shouichi finds three girls he could see himself having a future with: the ever-cheerful Hikari Tsuneki, who teases Shouichi without mercy, but actually has a softer side; the competitive gamer, Tooru Miyamae, who has difficulty communicating with others; and Shouichi's childhood friend, Kyouko Touno, the sometimes immature shoujo manga enthusiast. Seiren follows Shouichi's relationships with these three girls across three separate arcs, as their feelings grow from mutual interest and blossom into something more beautiful.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 2017, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "02:28", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 02:28 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 1557, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon Enterprises", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1557/Pony_Canyon_Enterprises"}, {"mal_id": 1601, "type": "anime", "name": "Stardust Promotion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1601/Stardust_Promotion"}, {"mal_id": 1602, "type": "anime", "name": "GYAO!", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1602/GYAO"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 418, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Gokumi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/418/Studio_Gokumi"}, {"mal_id": 1299, "type": "anime", "name": "AXsiZ", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1299/AXsiZ"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Prequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 11235, "type": "anime", "name": "Amagami SS+ Plus", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/11235/Amagami_SS__Plus"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Kimi no Hana (キミの花)\" by Hanako Oku"], "endings": ["1: \"Shunkan Happening (瞬間Happening)\" by Hikari Tsuneki (Ayane Sakura) (eps 1-3)", "2: \"Akaneiro ni Kakushite (アカネ色に隠して)\" by Hikari Tsuneki (Ayane Sakura) (eps 4)", "3: \"Muteki no Megami (ムテキの女神)\" by Tooru Miyamae (Shino Shimoji) (eps 5-7)", "4: \"Kimi to Yozora to Fortune to (キミと夜空とフォーチュンと)\" by Tooru Miyamae (Shino Shimoji) (eps 8)", "5: \"Koi no Theory (恋のセオリー)\" by Kyouko Touno (Juri Kimura) (eps 9-11)", "6: \"Futari Fuwari ra (ふたりふわりら)\" by Kyouko Touno (Juri Kimura) (eps 12)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/seiren/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=12327"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=18865"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%BB%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AC%E3%83%B3_(%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1)"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-272173"}]}}

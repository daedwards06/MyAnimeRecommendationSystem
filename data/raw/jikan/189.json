Now, at 20 years old, he has failed the required exam twice, leaving him disappointed and unsure about his future. One day, when Keitarou receives a call from his grandmother who tends to an inn, he believes that moving out will be a chance to focus on his studies.\n\nHowever, as Keitarou arrives at the building, he discovers that it has been transformed into an all-girls dormitory! Residing currently are five girls: Naru Narusegawa, a smart girl also trying to enroll in Tokyo University; Mitsune Konno, a mischievous and carefree freelance writer; Kaolla Su, an energetic engineer; Shinobu Maehara, a timid girl trying to fit in; and Motoko Aoyama, an earnest kendo enthusiast, each with their own opinion about Keitarou's arrival.\n\nDespite the harsh initial welcome, Keitarou becomes the manager of the building. Starting a new chapter in his life, he begins to learn more about the girls and their quirks, while not forgetting his ultimate goal—reuniting with the girl from his childhood.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Love Hina received ICv2's Anime Product of the Year award in 2002.", "season": "spring", "year": 2000, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "22:28", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 22:28 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 127, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiko Advertising", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Xebec", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 190, "type": "anime", "name": "Love Hina Again", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/190/Love_Hina_Again"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "manga", "name": "Love Hina", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/16/Love_Hina"}]}, {"relation": "Side Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 191, "type": "anime", "name": "Love Hina Christmas Special: Silent Eve", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/191/Love_Hina_Christmas_Special__Silent_Eve"}, {"mal_id": 192, "type": "anime", "name": "Love Hina Haru Special: Kimi Sakura Chiru Nakare!!", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/192/Love_Hina_Haru_Special__Kimi_Sakura_Chiru_Nakare"}, {"mal_id": 963, "type": "anime", "name": "Love Hina: Motoko no Sentaku, Koi ka Ken... \"Naku na\"", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/963/Love_Hina__Motoko_no_Sentaku_Koi_ka_Ken_Naku_na"}]}, {"relation": "Summary", "entry": [{"mal_id": 3247, "type": "anime", "name": "Love Hina Final Selection", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3247/Love_Hina_Final_Selection"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Sakura Saku\" by Megumi Hayashibara"], "endings": ["\"Hajimari wa Kokokara\" by Megumi Hayashibara (eps 24)", "\"Kimi Sae Ireba\" by Megumi Hayashibara (eps 1-23)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/anime/lovehina/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=35"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=168"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Hina"}], "streaming": []}}

One of them, a young girl named Chun, has just come of age and must undergo her rite of passage by experiencing the human world for herself. While there, she gets caught in a fishing net during a storm and is rescued by a human boy.\n\nHowever, the boy ends up drowning during the incident, and Chun returns to her realm full of guilt. Afterwards, she meets the Soul Keeper and decides to revive the boy in exchange for a part of her lifespan. Little does she know, meddling with the natural order of the world has severe consequences.\n\nDa Yu Hai Tang is a story about sacrifice and redemption as Chun comes to terms with the limitations of her powers and deals with death, love, and her own emotions. She must decide if she will sacrifice everything to save the human boy or forsake her moral obligation for the order of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1465, "type": "anime", "name": "Beijing Enlight Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1465/Beijing_Enlight_Pictures"}, {"mal_id": 1776, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Mir", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1776/Studio_Mir"}, {"mal_id": 2285, "type": "anime", "name": "Horgos Coloroom Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2285/Horgos_Coloroom_Pictures"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 1737, "type": "anime", "name": "Shout!

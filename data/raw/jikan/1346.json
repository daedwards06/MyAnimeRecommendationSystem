However, these cases grow increasingly complicated, threatening to upend the social order with the debate of what it means to be a human.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Initially planned for more episodes, production ceased after episode 3, due to the falling out between Artmic and Youmex. Following the bankruptcy of Artmic, Anime International Company (AIC) and Youmex took on the company's debts, which in turn, AIC would gain most of the IPs and other associated copyrights held by Artmic. Since December 2015, the AD Police IP, along with some of the other IPs held by AIC, have since been transferred to AIC RIGHTS. In North America, the series is licensed by AnimEigo, who first released the series in 1993, on VHS and Laserdisc in Japanese with English subtitles. In September 2015, AnimEigo launched a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter, to rerelease the series remastered on Blu-Ray, with a planned release date of sometime in 2016.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 220, "type": "anime", "name": "Youmex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/220/Youmex"}, {"mal_id": 230, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/230/Bandai"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 310, "type": "anime", "name": "AnimEigo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/310/AnimEigo"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}, {"mal_id": 72, "type": "anime", "name": "Artmic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/72/Artmic"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Suspense", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Suspense"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Detective", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Detective"}, {"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Gore", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/58/Gore"}, {"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1349, "type": "anime", "name": "A.D.

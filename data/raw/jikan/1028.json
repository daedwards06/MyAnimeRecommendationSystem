Arete wants none of this. She longs to meet the common people and travel to exotic lands she has only seen in the books she keeps hidden under her bed. One day the sorcerer Boax arrives in a fantastic flying machine and offers to take Arete as his wife and transform her into a proper princess.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 170, "type": "anime", "name": "Imagica", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/170/Imagica"}, {"mal_id": 1430, "type": "anime", "name": "Shogakukan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1430/Shogakukan"}, {"mal_id": 1584, "type": "anime", "name": "Beyond C.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1584/Beyond_C"}, {"mal_id": 1585, "type": "anime", "name": "Nichion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio 4°C", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/13/Studio_4%C2%B0C"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Красно Солнце (Krasno Solntse)\" by Origa"], "endings": ["\"kin'iro no tsubasa (金色の翼)\" by Taeko Oonuki"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.arete.jp/arete/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1190"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2163"}], "streaming": []}}

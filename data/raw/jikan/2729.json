Being the only music video that contains actual plot, the fourth video introduces some of the major characters and quickly lashes through the first few X manga (equivalent to X TV series episodes 1–3) which take place before the theatrical movie.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 3172, "type": "anime", "name": "Arts Pro", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3172/Arts_Pro"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 155, "type": "anime", "name": "X/1999", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/155/X_1999"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"X\" by X Japan"], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2894"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3579"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_TV"}], "streaming": []}}

A lone man named Momotarou opposed these gruesome, near-invincible monsters, but the war against them was just beginning.\n\nThousands of years in the future, temperamental gun enthusiast Shiki Ichinose leads a carefree life. However, after his expulsion from school, everything changes. Shiki is suddenly attacked by a man and is rescued by his adoptive father, Tsuyoshi. As the two flee, Tsuyoshi reveals that Shiki is actually a descendant of the Oni, while both he and their pursuer are from the Momotarou lineage.\n\nThe two Momotarou soon clash in a fierce battle, and Tsuyoshi sacrifices himself to protect Shiki. Devastated, Shiki awakens to his Oni blood that grants him immense strength at the cost of going berserk. Although the enemy escapes, Naito Mudano, an Oni teacher at Rasetsu Academy, takes an interest in Shiki. Under Mudano's guidance, Shiki must learn to control the Oni blood—if he ever hopes to avenge his father.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Tougen Anki aired on Nippon TV's Friday Anime Night block.", "season": "summer", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "23:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 23:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 53, "type": "anime", "name": "Dentsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/53/Dentsu"}, {"mal_id": 144, "type": "anime", "name": "Pony Canyon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/144/Pony_Canyon"}, {"mal_id": 1003, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Television Network", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"}, {"mal_id": 1373, "type": "anime", "name": "Akita Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1373/Akita_Shoten"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 101, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Hibari", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/101/Studio_Hibari"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Mythology", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Mythology"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 127436, "type": "manga", "name": "Tougen Anki", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/127436/Tougen_Anki"}]}, {"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 61891, "type": "anime", "name": "Onimomomomo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/61891/Onimomomomo"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["1: \"OVERNIGHT\" by THE ORAL CIGARETTES", "2: \"Amidakuji (阿弥陀籤)\" by Chougakusei (超学生)"], "endings": ["1: \"What is justice?\" by BAND-MAID", "2: \"ACTION\" by eill"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "https://tougenanki-anime.com/"}, {"name": "@tougenanki_anm", "url": "https://twitter.com/tougenanki_anm"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=18615"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=32714"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%A1%83%E6%BA%90%E6%9A%97%E9%AC%BC"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/7479"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-284026"}, {"name": "Netflix", "url": "https://www.netflix.com/"}, {"name": "Anime Digital Network", "url": "https://animedigitalnetwork.fr/"}, {"name": "Anime Generation", "url": "https://www.primevideo.com/gp/video/offers?benefitId=yamatoit"}, {"name": "Anime Onegai", "url": "https://www.animeonegai.com/"}, {"name": "Bahamut Anime Crazy", "url": "https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"}, {"name": "Bilibili Global", "url": "https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"}, {"name": "Laftel", "url": "https://laftel.net/"}, {"name": "iQIYI", "url": "https://www.iq.com/"}]}}

Now barely scraping by, he takes on an assistant coach job, resigned to a future far from the one he once imagined.\n\nBefore his first day, Tsukasa meets Inori Yuitsuka, a shy fifth grader sneaking into the rink to practice. Captivated by figure skating, but held back by her mother's overprotectiveness and her own self-doubt, Inori has never been encouraged to pursue her passion until she encounters Tsukasa. Beneath her personality lies great potential, waiting to be unlocked with the right guidance.\n\nMoved by Inori's determination to change and reminded of his own struggles, Tsukasa offers to coach and help her chase the dream she has been too afraid to voice. While the road ahead is long and filled with unfamiliar challenges and rival skaters, Inori dedicates herself to the art and strives to one day reach the Olympics and become a medalist. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Medalist aired on TV Asahi's NUMAnimation block.", "season": "winter", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "01:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 01:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 55, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Asahi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}, {"mal_id": 1255, "type": "anime", "name": "Glovision", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1255/Glovision"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1974, "type": "anime", "name": "ENGI", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1974/ENGI"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 70, "type": "anime", "name": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/70/Performing_Arts"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 61335, "type": "anime", "name": "Medalist 2nd Season", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/61335/Medalist_2nd_Season"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 129621, "type": "manga", "name": "Medalist", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/129621/Medalist"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"BOW AND ARROW\" by Kenshi Yonezu (米津玄師) (eps 2-13)"], "endings": ["1: \"BOW AND ARROW\" by Kenshi Yonezu (米津玄師) (eps 1)", "2: \"Atashi no Dress (アタシのドレス)\" by neguse.

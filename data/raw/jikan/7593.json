But since their fateful first encounter, a surge of incestuous love for their younger brother overcame the girls, beginning a lifelong feud for his heart.\n\nNow at the end of his middle school career, Keita studies fervently to be able to attend Ako and Riko's high school. While doing so however, he must resolve his conflicting feelings for his siblings and either reject or succumb to his sisters' intimate advances. Fortunately—or perhaps unfortunately for Keita—his sisters aren't the only women lusting after him, and there's no telling when the allure of temptation will get the better of the boy as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Episode 1 was pre-streamed on Bandai Channel on 25 March 2010.", "season": "spring", "year": 2010, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 92, "type": "anime", "name": "Starchild Records", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/92/Starchild_Records"}, {"mal_id": 721, "type": "anime", "name": "GANSIS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/721/GANSIS"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 91, "type": "anime", "name": "feel.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/91/feel"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 3048, "type": "manga", "name": "Kiss x Sis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/3048/Kiss_x_Sis"}]}, {"relation": "Parent Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 5042, "type": "anime", "name": "Kiss x Sis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5042/Kiss_x_Sis"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Balance KISS\" by Taketatsu Ayana & Tatsumi Yuiko"], "endings": ["1: \"Our Steady Boy\" by YuiKaori (eps 1-11)", "2: \"Futari\" by YuiKaori (eps 12)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.starchild.co.jp/special/kiss_sis/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=7215"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11169"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss×sis"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss%C3%97sis#%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/1904"}], "streaming": []}}

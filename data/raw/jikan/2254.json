As dictated by the Innocent, any Civilian that commits a crime is forgiven if they are not brought to justice within three days.\n \nCivilian Jiron Amos seeks revenge on the villainous outlaw Timp Sharon who murdered his parents, despite the fact the three-day period has long since passed. Hoping to get his revenge by stealing the mecha Xabungle from the merchant Carrying Cargo, Jiron teams up with a group of bandits known as the Sandrats and kidnaps Cargo's daughter Elchi, who ends up being sympathetic to his cause. Jiron's quest for revenge soon grows into a conflict much bigger—one that will eventually see the Civilians rise up against the Innocents' rule.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 1982, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "17:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 17:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 490, "type": "anime", "name": "Maiden Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/490/Maiden_Japan"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Summary", "entry": [{"mal_id": 5303, "type": "anime", "name": "Xabungle Graffiti", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5303/Xabungle_Graffiti"}]}, {"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 62530, "type": "anime", "name": "Blue Gale Xabungle Side-L", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/62530/Blue_Gale_Xabungle_Side-L"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Shippuu Xabungle (疾風ザブングル)\" by Akira Kushida"], "endings": ["\"Kawaita Daichi (乾いた大地)\" by Akira Kushida"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2357"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1992"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_Mecha_Xabungle"}], "streaming": [{"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/tv/blue-gale-xabungle"}]}}

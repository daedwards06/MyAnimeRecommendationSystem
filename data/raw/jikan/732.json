The story focuses on a small hamlet plagued by monster attacks and living under the shadow of rule by Count Magnus Lee, a powerful vampire lord who has ruled the land for thousands of years. When a young girl is bitten by the Count and chosen as his current plaything, she seeks out help of a quiet wandering stranger, D. It so happens that D is one of the world's best vampire hunters, and he takes it upon himself to cut through Magnus Lee's many minions, and put an end to the Count's rule.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 1480, "type": "anime", "name": "CBS Sony Group", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1480/CBS_Sony_Group"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 242, "type": "anime", "name": "Ashi Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/242/Ashi_Productions"}, {"mal_id": 1383, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Live", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1383/Studio_Live"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Vampire", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 543, "type": "anime", "name": "Vampire Hunter D (2000)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/543/Vampire_Hunter_D_2000"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 3988, "type": "manga", "name": "Vampire Hunter D", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/3988/Vampire_Hunter_D"}, {"mal_id": 172736, "type": "manga", "name": "Vampire Hunter D: Baraki", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/172736/Vampire_Hunter_D__Baraki"}, {"mal_id": 1360, "type": "manga", "name": "Vampire Hunter D", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1360/Vampire_Hunter_D"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": ["\"Your Song\" by TM NETWORK"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://vampire-d.com/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=204"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=654"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Hunter_D_(1985_film)"}], "streaming": []}}

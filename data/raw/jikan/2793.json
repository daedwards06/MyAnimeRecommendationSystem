Among them lives Godo Shingo, a candid young cadet who demonstrates uncommon kindness toward living creatures and robots alike. Although Godo's superiors ridicule him for showing attachment to his nursemaid robot, Olga, he makes quite an impression as a sharpshooter and is entrusted with a special task—to capture the legendary immortal bird Phoenix, which has destroyed countless spaceships.\n\nHowever, his life changes dramatically after falling in love with Rena, the president's daughter who is also the fiancée of Rock Holmes—the Chief of the Science Department. After the pair fails to elope, they are separated, and Godo is sentenced to prison camp labor. Luckily for him, their companions Olga and Pincho—Rena's alien pet—escape unnoticed and come to his rescue. \n\nHi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone follows an engaging adventure in outer space, exploring the idea of selfless love as an unparalleled power.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone, the first anime adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's Hi no Tori manga series, is based very loosely on the themes and elements of primarily the \"Future\" and \"Resurrection\" volumes. The movie features iconic characters of Tezuka's various works, with certain designs such as the Phoenix's having at least three renditions. The methods employed for special effects in the movie include scan camera shots, CGI, live-action filming, \"2-frame photography,\" 3D manipulation, rotoscoping, and more. Re-titled Space Firebird, the anime was one of the most widely distributed of the videos that have found their way into the Bargain Bin. The English version was first seen on US television in 1982, but was cut down by 20 minutes. A few months later, it was released in the UK on VHS & Betamax by Mountain Video in the same format and widely publicized. However, the video disappeared from store shelves two years later and was never re-released by another distributor. In the US, it was issued as VHS only in 1987 from the popular Celebrity Just For Kids. While the dub was the same, the movie was 10 minutes shorter, omitting some sundry scenes and the end credits. In 1980, Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone won the Inkpot Award at the San Diego Comic Convention and the Animation Award at the first Las Vegas Film Festival. It was also nominated at the Saturn Awards for the best animated movie category in 1983.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 245, "type": "anime", "name": "TOHO", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/TOHO"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 200, "type": "anime", "name": "Tezuka Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/200/Tezuka_Productions"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Spin-Off", "entry": [{"mal_id": 2997, "type": "anime", "name": "Hi no Tori: Houou-hen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2997/Hi_no_Tori__Houou-hen"}, {"mal_id": 2999, "type": "anime", "name": "Hi no Tori: Yamato-hen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2999/Hi_no_Tori__Yamato-hen"}, {"mal_id": 2998, "type": "anime", "name": "Hi no Tori: Uchuu-hen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2998/Hi_no_Tori__Uchuu-hen"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://en.tezuka.co.jp/anime/sakuhin/mv/mv012.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=1315"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1790"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_2772"}], "streaming": []}}

With his mother in the hospital and his brother fighting on the Western Front, the boy lives only with his father and his dog Hauser.\n\nOne weekend, cutting away from his usual chores, Sterling, his friend Oscar, and Hauser head off on a fishing trip. On their way to the river, his dog catches a scent at the base of a tree. Unearthing a raccoon's nest, the two boys find an orphaned kit. A passing hunter has killed the kit's mother to make a fur hat, leaving Sterling to adopt and care for the orphaned raccoon.\n\nTorn by his fracturing family, a brother in the trenches, along with the ailing health of his mother, Sterling's bonds with life and the world around him are kept together and strengthened by life with his new friend, the \"ring-tailed wonder\" and scoundrel, whom he names Rascal.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "winter", "year": 1977, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "19:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 19:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/22/Nippon_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 71, "type": "anime", "name": "Pets", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/71/Pets"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Side Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 37423, "type": "anime", "name": "Shiawase Pasta Story", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/37423/Shiawase_Pasta_Story"}]}, {"relation": "Spin-Off", "entry": [{"mal_id": 60506, "type": "anime", "name": "Araiguma Calcal-dan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/60506/Araiguma_Calcal-dan"}]}, {"relation": "Summary", "entry": [{"mal_id": 25089, "type": "anime", "name": "Araiguma Rascal Specials", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/25089/Araiguma_Rascal_Specials"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 17613, "type": "anime", "name": "Poka Poka Mori no Rascal", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/17613/Poka_Poka_Mori_no_Rascal"}]}, {"relation": "Character", "entry": [{"mal_id": 1638, "type": "anime", "name": "Peter Pan no Bouken", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1638/Peter_Pan_no_Bouken"}]}, {"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 21447, "type": "anime", "name": "Meitantei Rascal", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/21447/Meitantei_Rascal"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Rock River e (ロックリバーへ)\" by Columbia Yurikago Kai, Kumiko Oosugi, St. Mary's Children's Chorus"], "endings": ["\"Oide Rascal (おいでラスカル)\" by Kumiko Oosugi"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.bandaivisual.co.jp/kidstop/meisaku/rasukaru/rasukaru.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2306"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=437"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Araiguma_Rascal"}], "streaming": []}}

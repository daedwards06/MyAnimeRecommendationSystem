In an attempt to revitalize their nation, the army develops the next generation of battlefield weapons in the form of tactical suits known as Tactical Armor (TA). Despite giving a significant advantage in mobility, TAs place a heavy strain on their pilots, and few people are capable of handling them.\n\nYuushirou Gouwa is one such talented pilot who is unusually adept at steering these new machines. As the fourth son of the esteemed Gouwa family, Yuushirou is no stranger to the influence of powerful authority. His abilities and knowledge of the TAs are soon tested, as other geopolitical entities are also attempting to develop their own combat-ready versions. Things take a dire turn when Yuushirou encounters a mysterious girl, who cautions him of the future that awaits them should he revive a \"terror.\" While he tries to heed the warning, Yuushirou's family may be more involved in the rising conflict than they let on.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Gasaraki was released on DVD in North America by ADV Films from September 26, 2000, to January 29, 2002.", "season": "fall", "year": 1998, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "09:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 09:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 100, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Osaka", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/100/TV_Osaka"}, {"mal_id": 127, "type": "anime", "name": "Yomiko Advertising", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/127/Yomiko_Advertising"}, {"mal_id": 1175, "type": "anime", "name": "Atelier Musa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1175/Atelier_Musa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 217, "type": "anime", "name": "Nozomi Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 18549, "type": "manga", "name": "Gasaraki", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/18549/Gasaraki"}, {"mal_id": 160428, "type": "manga", "name": "Gasaraki", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/160428/Gasaraki"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["1: \"MESSAGE #9\" by Tomoko Tane (種ともこ) (eps 1-14,17-25)", "2: \"REMIX OF MESSAGE #9:type M\" by Tomoko Tane (種ともこ) (eps 15-16)"], "endings": ["\"Love Song\" by Tomoko Tane"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.gasaraki.net/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=240"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=264"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasaraki"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-272601"}]}}

They have access to otherwise unavailable funds and information that allow them to pursue their dreams and interests. However, being a hunter is a special privilege, only attained by taking a deadly exam with an extremely low success rate.\n\nGon Freecss, a 12-year-old boy with the hope of finding his missing father, sets out on a quest to take the Hunter Exam. Along the way, he picks up three companions who also aim to take the dangerous test: the revenge-seeking Kurapika, aspiring doctor Leorio Paladiknight, and a mischievous child the same age as Gon, Killua Zoldyck.\n\nAs the four aspiring hunters embark on a perilous adventure, they fight for their dreams while defying the odds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 1999, "broadcast": {"day": "Saturdays", "time": "18:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Saturdays at 18:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 119, "type": "anime", "name": "VIZ Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/22/Nippon_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 137, "type": "anime", "name": "Hunter x Hunter: Original Video Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/137/Hunter_x_Hunter__Original_Video_Animation"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 26, "type": "manga", "name": "Hunter x Hunter", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/26/Hunter_x_Hunter"}]}, {"relation": "Side Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 10189, "type": "anime", "name": "Hunter x Hunter Pilot", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/10189/Hunter_x_Hunter_Pilot"}]}, {"relation": "Alternative Version", "entry": [{"mal_id": 11061, "type": "anime", "name": "Hunter x Hunter (2011)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/11061/Hunter_x_Hunter_2011"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["1: \"Ohayou (おはよう)\" by Keno (eps 1-48)", "2: \"Taiyou wa Yoru mo Kagayaku (太陽は夜も輝く)\" by Wino (eps 49-62)"], "endings": ["1: \"Kaze no Uta; Song of the Wind\" by Minako Honda (eps 1-31)", "2: \"E-Jan - Do You Feel Like I Feel\" by Masato Nagai (eps 32-52)", "3: \"Hotaru\" by Masato Nagai (eps 53-62)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.nippon-animation.co.jp/na/hunter/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=132"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1134"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_%C3%97_Hunter_(1999_TV_series)"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUNTER%C3%97HUNTER_(1999%E5%B9%B4%E3%81%AE%E3%82%A2%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A1)"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/927"}], "streaming": []}}

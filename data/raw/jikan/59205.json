Unfortunately, the 13 heroes dispatched to the southern region are easily wiped out by Clevatess, one of the Lords of Dark Beasts. Determined to get revenge against humanity, Clevatess bursts into the capital of the Kingdom of Hiden, leaving a trail of death and destruction behind him.\n\nAlthough the situation looks desperate, humanity still has a chance to appease Clevatess' anger. Alicia Glenfall, one of the 13 heroes, is revived by Clevatess to help him raise a newborn infant, Luna, whose choices shall shape the fate of the human world. Although reluctant to help the dark beast at first, Alicia understands that Luna is the only thing that stands between humanity and complete annihilation. \n\nHiding himself by taking on a human form, Clevatess sets out in search for a wet nurse with Alicia and Luna. With Clevatess unwilling to reveal his identity, it falls on Alicia to slay all enemies that stand in their way. Meanwhile, the neighboring countries prepare to advance on the weakened Hiden, aiming to control the only forge capable of producing the heroes' weapons.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Wednesdays", "time": "20:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Wednesdays at 20:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 1345, "type": "anime", "name": "Sammy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1345/Sammy"}, {"mal_id": 1468, "type": "anime", "name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1468/Crunchyroll"}, {"mal_id": 1680, "type": "anime", "name": "BS NTV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1680/BS_NTV"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 2017, "type": "anime", "name": "Culture Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2017/Culture_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 2640, "type": "anime", "name": "INSPION Edge", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2640/INSPION_Edge"}, {"mal_id": 2876, "type": "anime", "name": "Line Digital Frontier", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2876/Line_Digital_Frontier"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1087, "type": "anime", "name": "Lay-duce", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1087/Lay-duce"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 62513, "type": "anime", "name": "Clevatess II: Majuu no Ou to Itsuwari no Yuusha Denshou", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/62513/Clevatess_II__Majuu_no_Ou_to_Itsuwari_no_Yuusha_Denshou"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 138396, "type": "manga", "name": "Clevatess: Majuu no Ou to Akago to Shikabane no Yuusha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/138396/Clevatess__Majuu_no_Ou_to_Akago_to_Shikabane_no_Yuusha"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Ruler\" by Mayu Maeshima (前島麻由) (eps 2-11)"], "endings": ["1: \"Ruler\" by Mayu Maeshima (前島麻由) (eps 1,12)", "2: \"Destiny\" by ︀︀Ellie Goulding (eps 2-11)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "https://clevatess.com/"}, {"name": "@clevatess_anime", "url": "https://twitter.com/clevatess_anime"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=18730"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=32863"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clevatess"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/クレバテス-魔獣の王と赤子と屍の勇者-#テレビアニメ"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/7493"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-283993"}, {"name": "Ani-One Asia", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0wNSTMWIL3qaorLx0jie6A"}, {"name": "Aniplus TV", "url": "http://www.aniplustv.com/"}, {"name": "Bahamut Anime Crazy", "url": "https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"}]}}

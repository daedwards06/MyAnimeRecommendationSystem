Lost amidst hoards of buyers, sellers, and cosplayers, Kazuki is about to be baptized by fire, all in order to lead him toward his true calling: to take over the world through fan comics!\n\nMeanwhile, Kazuki's childhood friend Mizuki isn't about to let him be dragged from his normal life without a fight! But will she be able to stop the addictive draw of the new world that lies before Kazuki? Little by little, Kazuki is slipping down the path towards destiny—and Taishi is shoving him every step of the way! \n\n(Source: RightStuf)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2001, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "KSS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/50/KSS"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 217, "type": "anime", "name": "Nozomi Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "OLM", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 69, "type": "anime", "name": "Otaku Culture", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/69/Otaku_Culture"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 5147, "type": "anime", "name": "Comic Party Revolution OVA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5147/Comic_Party_Revolution_OVA"}, {"mal_id": 706, "type": "anime", "name": "Comic Party Revolution", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/706/Comic_Party_Revolution"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 169, "type": "manga", "name": "Comic Party", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/169/Comic_Party"}]}, {"relation": "Side Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 707, "type": "anime", "name": "Comic Party Specials", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/707/Comic_Party_Specials"}]}, {"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 472, "type": "anime", "name": "To Heart", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/472/To_Heart"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Kimi no Mama de\" by Emi Motoda"], "endings": ["\"Katachi no Nai Machi wo Mezashite\" by Kaya"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.aquaplus.co.jp/cp/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=116"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1150"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Party"}], "streaming": []}}

It is inspired by Japanese novelist Murakami Haruki's book Sekai no Owari to Hard-Boiled Wonderland (Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World). The music was done by Tenmon, who's also responsible for the music in Shinkai's Kanojo to Kanojo no Neko, Hoshi no Koe, and Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho.\n\nOnly 30 seconds long, this short was originally viewable at Shinkai's website but has since been taken down due to bandwidth issues. Its chances of getting a proper release are slim, as Shinkai intended it only as practice using 3DCG programs.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www2.odn.ne.jp/~ccs50140/closed/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=2037"}], "streaming": []}}

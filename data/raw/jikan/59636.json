Jou Kitahara, a rookie trainer with big dreams and modest expectations, does not expect to find talent in the quiet town of Kasamatsu—until he meets an ash-gray-haired girl with a wild, unconventional stride.\n\nAs a child with bad knees, Oguri Cap spent much of her early life in pain, struggling to stand. But through relentless perseverance, she overcame her limits and found liberation in the very thing that once seemed impossible: running. While the other horse girls at Kasamatsu chase victory and fame, Oguri runs without ambition, driven only by the joy of movement.\n\nFujimasa March, a rising regional star, commands attention with her discipline, talent, and tenacity. For her, running is a matter of pride. But when a school-organized race brings her face-to-face with Oguri's raw, unpolished stride, March's confidence begins to waver. In turn, something in Oguri shifts after racing March. For the first time, a spark of ambition ignites within her—a desire to win that will take her beyond the confines of her hometown to the grand stages waiting on the horizon.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Uma Musume: Cinderella Gray was released on Blu-ray in four volumes from September 17, 2025, to December 17, 2025.", "season": "spring", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "16:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 16:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 145, "type": "anime", "name": "TBS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/145/TBS"}, {"mal_id": 1397, "type": "anime", "name": "Universal Music Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1397/Universal_Music_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1587, "type": "anime", "name": "Cygames", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1587/Cygames"}, {"mal_id": 2074, "type": "anime", "name": "Bit grooove promotion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2074/Bit_grooove_promotion"}, {"mal_id": 2751, "type": "anime", "name": "Happinet Media Marketing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2751/Happinet_Media_Marketing"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1893, "type": "anime", "name": "CygamesPictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1893/CygamesPictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 51, "type": "anime", "name": "Anthropomorphic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/51/Anthropomorphic"}, {"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Racing", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Racing"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 61930, "type": "anime", "name": "Uma Musume: Cinderella Gray Part 2", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/61930/Uma_Musume__Cinderella_Gray_Part_2"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 133431, "type": "manga", "name": "Uma Musume Cinderella Gray", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/133431/Uma_Musume_Cinderella_Gray"}]}, {"relation": "Parent Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 35249, "type": "anime", "name": "Uma Musume: Pretty Derby", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/35249/Uma_Musume__Pretty_Derby"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Koeru (超える)\" by [Alexandros]"], "endings": ["\"∞\" by Oguri Cap (CV: Tomoyo Takayanagi)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "https://anime-cinderellagray.com/"}, {"name": "@umamusu_animeCG", "url": "https://twitter.com/umamusu_animeCG"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=18829"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=33371"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uma_Musume_Pretty_Derby#Uma_Musume:_Cinderella_Gray_(anime)"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%82%A6%E3%83%9E%E5%A8%98_%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%83%AC%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B0%E3%83%AC%E3%82%A4"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/7388"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Netflix", "url": "https://www.netflix.com/"}, {"name": "Anime Digital Network", "url": "https://animedigitalnetwork.fr/"}, {"name": "Anime Onegai", "url": "https://www.animeonegai.com/"}]}}

He can return to reality by falling asleep or dying, and he can pick up where he left off by sleeping again. For years, he has had many adventures alongside Mariabelle, a beautiful elf who works for the Sorcery Guild.\n\nOn one of their escapades, they come across the lair of a dragon taking care of its eggs. They inadvertently wake the slumbering beast, who promptly reduces them to ashes. For Kazuhiro, it is merely a temporary setback, as he can simply go back. However, he is shocked to find Mariabelle herself safe and sound asleep next to him.\n\nKazuhiro realizes that his dream world is an alternate reality altogether. In the meantime, he makes the most of this bizarre circumstance, introducing Mariabelle to the sights and wonders of Japan. Now, with their time together spanning two worlds, their real adventures have just begun!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Nihon e Youkoso Elf-san. was released on Blu-ray as a complete box set on June 11, 2025.", "season": "winter", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Fridays", "time": "22:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Fridays at 22:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 141, "type": "anime", "name": "Toei Video", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/141/Toei_Video"}, {"mal_id": 143, "type": "anime", "name": "Mainichi Broadcasting System", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/143/Mainichi_Broadcasting_System"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}, {"mal_id": 315, "type": "anime", "name": "DAX Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/315/DAX_Production"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 547, "type": "anime", "name": "Hobby Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/547/Hobby_Japan"}, {"mal_id": 1416, "type": "anime", "name": "BS11", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1416/BS11"}, {"mal_id": 1996, "type": "anime", "name": "MAGNET", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1996/MAGNET"}, {"mal_id": 2425, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Music Live", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2425/Bandai_Namco_Music_Live"}, {"mal_id": 2840, "type": "anime", "name": "qooop", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2840/qooop"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1379, "type": "anime", "name": "Zero-G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1379/Zero-G"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Isekai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 119084, "type": "manga", "name": "Nihon e Youkoso Elf-san.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/119084/Nihon_e_Youkoso_Elf-san"}, {"mal_id": 117446, "type": "manga", "name": "Nihon e Youkoso Elf-san.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/117446/Nihon_e_Youkoso_Elf-san"}]}, {"relation": "Other", "entry": [{"mal_id": 60295, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon e Youkoso Elf-san Mini Anime", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/60295/Nihon_e_Youkoso_Elf-san_Mini_Anime"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Palette Days\" by Rico Sasaki (佐々木李子)"], "endings": ["\"Yummy Yummy\" by Kaede Higuchi (樋口楓), Kanae (叶)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "https://welcome-elfsan.com/"}, {"name": "@welcome_elfsan", "url": "https://twitter.com/welcome_elfsan"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=18361"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=31172"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Japan,_Ms._Elf!"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%B8%E3%82%88%E3%81%86%E3%81%93%E3%81%9D%E3%82%A8%E3%83%AB%E3%83%95%E3%81%95%E3%82%93%E3%80%82"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/7283"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-283948"}, {"name": "Aniplus TV", "url": "http://www.aniplustv.com/"}, {"name": "Bahamut Anime Crazy", "url": "https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"}, {"name": "Bilibili Global", "url": "https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"}, {"name": "Laftel", "url": "https://laftel.net/"}]}}

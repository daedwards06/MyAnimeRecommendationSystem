While strategizing his ideal placement in the Force, he discovers that he is assigned to the Green Squadron, whose main duty is to search and eradicate long-lost boss monsters.\n\nJoined by another new member, Angel Usukubo; their senior, Kanon Hisui; and a mysterious informant, Chidori, Sentouin D is first tasked with identifying suspicious activity in an abandoned school frequented by delinquents. During their investigation, they fall into a trap, and the group soon realizes that a boss monster is behind it all. Sentouin D must now find a way to escape alongside the others if he wants to continue pursuing his ultimate goal—achieving his ideal world free from boss monsters and the Dragon Keepers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Sentai Daishikkaku 2nd Season aired on CBC and TBS' Agaru Anime block.

Certain that it is not the Hikaru he knows who came back, Yoshiki finally asks Hikaru about it. Suddenly, \"Hikaru\" reveals his true monstrous form and begs Yoshiki to keep it a secret, as he does not want to kill him.\n\nDespite his paranormal nature, \"Hikaru\" seems almost innocent, full of childlike wonder and eager to experience the summer heat, the countryside, and all kinds of other things in a human body for the first time. And for Yoshiki, it matters little if \"Hikaru\" is a fake relying on stolen memories—as long as he never leaves again. As Yoshiki desperately clings to \"Hikaru\" in his intense grief, it becomes increasingly clear that something dangerous and supernatural may have descended from the mountains into their village.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "summer", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "00:55", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:55 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1003, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Television Network", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1003/Nippon_Television_Network"}, {"mal_id": 1422, "type": "anime", "name": "CyberAgent", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1422/CyberAgent"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}, {"mal_id": 1856, "type": "anime", "name": "dugout", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1856/dugout"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1893, "type": "anime", "name": "CygamesPictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1893/CygamesPictures"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Sequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 62584, "type": "anime", "name": "Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu 2nd Season", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/62584/Hikaru_ga_Shinda_Natsu_2nd_Season"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 141833, "type": "manga", "name": "Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/141833/Hikaru_ga_Shinda_Natsu"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Saikai (再会)\" by Vaundy"], "endings": ["1: \"Anata wa Kaibutsu (あなたはかいぶつ)\" by TOOBOE (eps 2-6)", "2: \"Hibi no Kage (日々の影)\" by Yoshiki Tsujinaka (CV: Chiaki Kobayashi), Hikaru (CV: Shuuichirou Umeda) (eps 7)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "https://hikanatsu-anime.com/"}, {"name": "@hikanatsu_anime", "url": "https://twitter.com/hikanatsu_anime"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=18649"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=32758"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Summer_Hikaru_Died"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%85%89%E3%81%8C%E6%AD%BB%E3%82%93%E3%81%A0%E5%A4%8F"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/7513"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Netflix", "url": "https://www.netflix.com/"}]}}

It remains populated by forgotten pasts and the ruins of their labors due to a calamity 40 years ago. Shrouded in a fog-like mystery, it is up to people like Roger Smith to shine a light through the mist. Acting as a professional negotiator and suave agent, Roger is a self-tailored ladies man whose only love is for funeral black. However, as he gets deeply involved with his clients, what often starts as a simple negotiation evolves into Roger saving Paradigm from crime and peril.\n\nIn the process, Roger stumbles even deeper into the untold folds of the city. As a rule, things are hardly ever as they appear. Serving as gray knight in a gray world, Roger is not without allies. By his side are Norman, a loyal and widely skilled butler, and Dorothy, a human-like android with deadpan snark. Together with the relic Big O, a jet-black mecha of gargantuan size and weight, they help Roger serve iron justice to Paradigm's lurking villains as he discovers the truth about 40 years ago.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 1999, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": "Unknown"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "Adult Cast", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/50/Adult_Cast"}, {"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 283, "type": "manga", "name": "The Big O", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/283/The_Big_O"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["1: \"Big-O!\" by Rui Nagai (3-13)", "2: \"Respect\" by Sahashi (15-20, 22-25)"], "endings": ["\"And Forever...\" by Robbie Danzie with Naoki Takao"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.the-big-o.net/index.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=904"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=231"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_O"}], "streaming": [{"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/tv/the-big-o"}]}}

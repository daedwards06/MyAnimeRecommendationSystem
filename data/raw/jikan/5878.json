Decades ago, when he served in the Vietnam War, Robert developed a relationship with Lamina, a mysterious woman with healing powers he had found in the jungle. Unfortunately, they were tragically separated as a result of the fighting and Robert has not seen her since. Though it seems unlikely, Robert gives his son an old harmonica in the hopes he can pass it on to her.\n\nWhen Subaru arrives in Vietnam, he does not have any hope that he will be able to locate Lamina and fulfill his father's request. But in a shocking surprise, Subaru not only finds Lamina, but also sees that she has not aged a day since meeting his father. Intrigued, Subaru unknowingly stumbles into a mystery that goes far beyond his microbiological research.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 200, "type": "anime", "name": "Tezuka Productions", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/200/Tezuka_Productions"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": ["\"Sugao no mama de (素顔のままで)\" by Nagayama Youko"]}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=3622"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4832"}], "streaming": []}}

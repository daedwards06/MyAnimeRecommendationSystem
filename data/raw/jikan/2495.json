Yuki is an independent girl who ran away from her home in Hakodate. She is working in the concert hall of Reika's performance. Nozomi is the daughter from a wealthy family in Kobe. She's got one of the VIP seats at the concert. \n\nThe three girls are so inspired by Reika's performance, that they all enroll in the Akiba music school and endeavor to become pop idols themselves. \n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)", "background": "", "season": "spring", "year": 2001, "broadcast": {"day": "Mondays", "time": "01:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Mondays at 01:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 52, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/52/Avex_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 3165, "type": "anime", "name": "Avex Mode", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3165/Avex_Mode"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 60, "type": "anime", "name": "Idols (Female)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/60/Idols_Female"}, {"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Pure Blue\" by Atsuko Enomoto, Mayumi Iizuka, and Maria Yamamoto"], "endings": ["\"Love Forever\" by Atsuko Enomoto, Mayumi Iizuka, and Maria Yamamoto"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.madhouse.co.jp/works/2001-2000/works_tv_chance.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=563"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=1022"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chance_Pop_Session"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "http://www.crunchyroll.com/series-89607"}, {"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/tv/chance-pop-session"}]}}

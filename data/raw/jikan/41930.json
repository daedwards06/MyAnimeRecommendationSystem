But being a teenager preoccupied with his problems, Youta finds it hard to believe such a preposterous claim.\n\nSomehow forced to tag along with her antics, he witnesses the effectiveness of Hina's skills with his own eyes and realizes that she truly is capable of divination. Nevertheless, despite her persistence in being a god, Hina is still a child who desires to see and experience the wonders life has to offer. With the world ending in 30 days, Hina, Youta, and their friends venture forward to create lasting memories they will cherish forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2020, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "00:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 00:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 203, "type": "anime", "name": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/203/Visual_Arts"}, {"mal_id": 1211, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo MX", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1211/Tokyo_MX"}, {"mal_id": 1366, "type": "anime", "name": "Nagoya Broadcasting Network", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1366/Nagoya_Broadcasting_Network"}, {"mal_id": 1500, "type": "anime", "name": "ABC Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1500/ABC_Animation"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 132, "type": "anime", "name": "P.A.

He has friends, a crush, and a passion for kendo. Dejected after losing to his kendo rival, Shuu climbs a smokestack to watch the sunset where he finds Lala-Ru, a quiet, blue-haired girl wearing a strange pendant. Shuu attempts to befriend her, despite her uninterested, bland responses.\n\nHowever, his hopes are crushed when a woman, accompanied by two serpentine machines, appear out of thin air with one goal in mind: capture Lala-Ru. Shuu, bull-headed as he is, tries to save his new friend from her kidnappers and is transported to a desert world, unlike anything he has ever seen before. Yet, despite the circumstances, Shuu only thinks of saving Lala-Ru, until he is thoroughly beaten up by some soldiers. As he soon finds out, Lala-Ru can manipulate water and her pendant is the source from which she is able to bring forth the liquid, a scarce commodity in his new environment. But now, the pendant is lost, and Shuu is the prime suspect.\n\nIma, Soko ni Iru Boku is the haunting story of a dystopian world, and of Shuu, who has to endure torture, hunger, and the horrors of war in order to save the lonely girl he found sitting atop a smokestack.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 1999, "broadcast": {"day": "Thursdays", "time": "19:00", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Thursdays at 19:00 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 123, "type": "anime", "name": "Victor Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/123/Victor_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 204, "type": "anime", "name": "Pioneer LDC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/204/Pioneer_LDC"}, {"mal_id": 211, "type": "anime", "name": "Rakuonsha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/211/Rakuonsha"}, {"mal_id": 3098, "type": "anime", "name": "Aquatone", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3098/Aquatone"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 284, "type": "anime", "name": "Central Park Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Isekai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku (今、そこにいる僕)\" by Toshio Masuda (増田俊郎)"], "endings": ["\"Komoriuta...

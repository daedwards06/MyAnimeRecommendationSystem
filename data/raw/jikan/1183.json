The victorious walk away with millions, and the defeated lose everything (namely, all their clothes).\n\nBut this high-stakes sport has dark forces and dubious practices behind the fun and games. Lethal injections make steroids seem like vitamins. Instead of team prayer, there's demonic possession. Athletic sponsors are malevolent corporations with a more frightening agenda than increased market share. It's all just part of the game.\n\n(Source: AniDB)", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 50, "type": "anime", "name": "KSS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/50/KSS"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 462, "type": "anime", "name": "Chaos Project", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/462/Chaos_Project"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Martial Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Alternative Setting", "entry": [{"mal_id": 2209, "type": "anime", "name": "V.G.Neo The Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2209/VGNeo_The_Animation"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Kaze ni Naritai (風になりたい)\" by Nakajima Erina"], "endings": []}, "external": [{"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=913"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=766"}], "streaming": []}}

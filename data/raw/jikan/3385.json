As he is giving him a tour of the city, Falco suggests they visit the slave market: a place where captured women are sold at exorbitant prices to wealthy bureaucrats. Casius is initially hesitant to take part in the debauchery, but eventually has a change of heart and buys the girls in order to protect them. Unbeknownst to him, the girls he purchased will soon send him headfirst into a series of tumultuous events.\n\nDorei Ichiba follows Casius as he spends his days in the foreign city with his three slaves—Bianca, a childish woman who calls him 'big brother'; Cecilia, a peasant who ran away from her abusive, blue-blooded fiance; and Myia, a mute girl with dark secrets. As he uncovers their tragic stories while making love to them, he finds himself slowly succumbing to a carnal desire that threatens to change him for good.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Based on the game developed by rúf in 2000.", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 294, "type": "anime", "name": "Discovery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/294/Discovery"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 284, "type": "anime", "name": "Central Park Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}, {"mal_id": 296, "type": "anime", "name": "Critical Mass Video", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/296/Critical_Mass_Video"}], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 78939, "type": "manga", "name": "Dorei Ichiba", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/78939/Dorei_Ichiba"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"To lose in amber\" by Shimamiya Eiko"], "endings": ["1: \"To lose in amber\" by Shimamiya Eiko", "2: \"Inori no Toki\" by MELL"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.seddnet.com/products/dorei.html"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=608"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=5387"}], "streaming": []}}

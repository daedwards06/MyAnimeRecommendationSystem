Young and alone, Pig finds love and family through his friendship with Fox, and continues to care for the townsfolk in a variety of ways. However, Pig struggles with the absence of his father, and his desire to search for his father competes with his need to keep the town safe.\n\n(Source: ANN)", "background": "Hulu Japan produced the series, first announced under the title \"Dam Keeper no Nakama-tachi\" (The Dam Keeper's Friends).

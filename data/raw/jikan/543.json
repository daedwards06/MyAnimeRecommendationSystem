Water turns into ice before these blood-sucking monsters, and their victims realize that this uncanny chill is the harbinger of their inevitable demise. Fortunately, the number of vampires is dwindling thanks to the dauntless bounty hunters who track down and slay the near-immortal predators.\n\nOne night, tragedy befalls the Elbourne family as their daughter, Charlotte, is abducted by Meier Link, a revered vampire lord protected by an army of monsters. To save their beloved Charlotte, her family recruits the Marcus Brothers, a group of vampire hunters known for their ruthlessness; and D, a sword-wielding dhampir—a half-vampire, half-human who has the strengths of both species and the weaknesses of neither.\n\nThe hunters rush to rescue Charlotte, but if her abductor decides to turn her into a vampire, they should eliminate her. Moreover, their mission must be completed before Meier reaches the impregnable vampire castle of Carmilla and takes Charlotte out of humanity's reach forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 426, "type": "anime", "name": "Filmlink International", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/426/Filmlink_International"}, {"mal_id": 1906, "type": "anime", "name": "animate", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1906/animate"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Vampire", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/32/Vampire"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Prequel", "entry": [{"mal_id": 732, "type": "anime", "name": "Vampire Hunter D", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/732/Vampire_Hunter_D"}]}, {"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 3988, "type": "manga", "name": "Vampire Hunter D", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/3988/Vampire_Hunter_D"}, {"mal_id": 172736, "type": "manga", "name": "Vampire Hunter D: Baraki", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/172736/Vampire_Hunter_D__Baraki"}, {"mal_id": 1360, "type": "manga", "name": "Vampire Hunter D", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1360/Vampire_Hunter_D"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": ["\"Tooku Made\" by Do As Infinity"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://vampire-d.com/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=66"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=238"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_Hunter_D:_Bloodlust"}], "streaming": [{"name": "HIDIVE", "url": "https://www.hidive.com/movies/vampire-hunter-d"}]}}

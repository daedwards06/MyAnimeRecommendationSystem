From this place from where no one has ever come back, three tormented souls who refer to themselves as Sinners of Hell burst in Karakura Town, where a ruthless fight involving them against the substitute Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki and his friends ensues. In the aftermath of the fight, Ichigo's sisters are abducted, with the aforementioned group's leader Shuren hoping to lure Ichigo to be finally freed from the chains of Hell.\n\nHelped by a Sinner named Kokutou, Ichigo and his friends head to Hell for a rescue mission. However, the Soul Society opposes the journey, in fear of threatening the balance between worlds. As the lines between friends and foes get blurred, Ichigo will have to face his most challenging dilemma yet—a decision that may well engulf the three worlds into chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": null, "year": null, "broadcast": {"day": null, "time": null, "timezone": null, "string": null}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 119, "type": "anime", "name": "VIZ Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/119/VIZ_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Pierrot", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Studio_Pierrot"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 23355, "type": "manga", "name": "Bleach: The Unforgivens", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/23355/Bleach__The_Unforgivens"}]}, {"relation": "Parent Story", "entry": [{"mal_id": 269, "type": "anime", "name": "Bleach", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach"}]}], "theme": {"openings": [], "endings": ["\"Save The One, Save The All\" by T.M.Revolution"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "http://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/bleach/"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=7666"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=11723"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(manga)#Films"}, {"name": "Bangumi", "url": "https://bangumi.tv/subject/18480"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Netflix", "url": "https://www.netflix.com/"}, {"name": "AmasianTV", "url": "https://amasian.tv/video/movies/bleach-movie4-hellverse-dub/bleach-movie4-hellverse-dub"}]}}

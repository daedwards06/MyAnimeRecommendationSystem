She has the power to transform her surroundings by manipulating the elements of the periodic table. On top of that, Ellen also has a great amount of scientific knowledge due to being a scientist in her past life.\n\nDuring the war against a neighboring kingdom, Rovel Vankreift, the hero of the Kingdom of Tenbahl and eldest son of house Vankreift—as well as Ellen's father—was fatally injured. However, the spirit who fought by Rovel's side, Lady Origin, brought him to her realm to save him from the clutches of death. Lady Origin, who happens to be the Queen of the Spirit Realm as well as Ellen's eventual mother, is one of the most powerful spirits in existence, making little Ellen quite powerful in contrast to her innocent looks.\n\nBut even a family as happy as this one has its fair share of problems, as Ellen and her parents are forced to reconnect their old ties to the Vankreift household in order to defend their relatives' honor—all while hiding Ellen's dangerous existence from the public to preserve their undisturbed happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "", "season": "fall", "year": 2025, "broadcast": {"day": "Sundays", "time": "23:30", "timezone": "Asia/Tokyo", "string": "Sundays at 23:30 (JST)"}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "VAP", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/29/VAP"}, {"mal_id": 306, "type": "anime", "name": "Magic Capsule", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/306/Magic_Capsule"}, {"mal_id": 323, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Columbia", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/323/Nippon_Columbia"}, {"mal_id": 460, "type": "anime", "name": "KlockWorx", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/460/KlockWorx"}, {"mal_id": 1414, "type": "anime", "name": "bilibili", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1414/bilibili"}, {"mal_id": 1696, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1696/Kadokawa"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 62, "type": "anime", "name": "Isekai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/62/Isekai"}, {"mal_id": 72, "type": "anime", "name": "Reincarnation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/72/Reincarnation"}], "demographics": [], "relations": [{"relation": "Adaptation", "entry": [{"mal_id": 119656, "type": "manga", "name": "Chichi wa Eiyuu, Haha wa Seirei, Musume no Watashi wa Tenseisha.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/119656/Chichi_wa_Eiyuu_Haha_wa_Seirei_Musume_no_Watashi_wa_Tenseisha"}, {"mal_id": 128263, "type": "manga", "name": "Chichi wa Eiyuu, Haha wa Seirei, Musume no Watashi wa Tenseisha.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/128263/Chichi_wa_Eiyuu_Haha_wa_Seirei_Musume_no_Watashi_wa_Tenseisha"}]}], "theme": {"openings": ["\"Mahou (魔法)\" by Caho (果歩)"], "endings": ["\"Family\" by Yui Nishio (ゆいにしお)"]}, "external": [{"name": "Official Site", "url": "https://hahanoha-anime.com/"}, {"name": "@hahanoha_anime", "url": "https://twitter.com/hahanoha_anime"}, {"name": "AniDB", "url": "https://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.pl?show=anime&aid=18437"}, {"name": "ANN", "url": "https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=31706"}, {"name": "Wikipedia", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnated_as_the_Daughter_of_the_Legendary_Hero_and_the_Queen_of_Spirits"}, {"name": "Syoboi", "url": "https://cal.syoboi.jp/tid/7572"}], "streaming": [{"name": "Crunchyroll", "url": "https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GT00364479"}, {"name": "Ani-One Asia", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0wNSTMWIL3qaorLx0jie6A"}, {"name": "Bahamut Anime Crazy", "url": "https://ani.gamer.com.tw/"}, {"name": "Bilibili Global", "url": "https://www.bilibili.tv/en/index"}]}}

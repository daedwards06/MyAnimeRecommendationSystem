35760,Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3,"Still threatened by the ""Titans"" that rob them of their freedom, mankind remains caged inside the two remaining walls. Efforts to eradicate these monsters continue; however, threats arise not only from the Titans beyond the walls, but from the humans within them as well.

After being rescued from the Colossal and Armored Titans, Eren Yaeger devotes himself to improving his Titan form. Krista Lenz struggles to accept the loss of her friend, Captain Levi chooses Eren and his friends to form his new personal squad, and Commander Erwin Smith recovers from his injuries. All seems well for the soldiers, until the government suddenly demands custody of Eren and Krista. The Survey Corps' recent successes have drawn attention, and a familiar face from Levi's past is sent to collect the wanted soldiers. Sought after by the government, Levi and his new squad must evade their adversaries in hopes of keeping Eren and Krista safe.

Eren and his fellow soldiers are not only fighting for their survival against the terrifying Titans, but also against the terror of a far more conniving foe: their fellow humans.

It's said to be warm and fertile, a place where there would be no need for fighting—not at all like the frozen village in Iceland where he was born, and certainly not like his current life as a mercenary. War is his home now. Though his father once told him, ""You have no enemies, nobody does. There is nobody who it's okay to hurt,"" as he grew, Thorfinn knew that nothing was further from the truth.

The war between England and the Danes grows worse with each passing year. Death has become commonplace, and the viking mercenaries are loving every moment of it. Allying with either side will cause a massive swing in the balance of power, and the vikings are happy to make names for themselves and take any spoils they earn along the way. Among the chaos, Thorfinn must take his revenge and kill Askeladd, the man who murdered his father. The only paradise for the vikings, it seems, is the era of war and death that rages on.

To this end, he publicly states his intention to study theology—the academic field held in highest regard in early 15th century Poland. However, an encounter with a mysterious man upends Rafal's life, sparking an illogical desire to instead pursue his passion for astronomy.

Rafal is determined to prove the beauty and rationality of heliocentrism—the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. This belief is considered heretical by the powerful Church, which promotes geocentrism—the Sun revolving around the Earth—as the sole truth of the universe. Those whose beliefs do not align with the will of the Church suffer unfathomably gruesome consequences.

In pursuit of evidence for a heliocentric model of the universe, Rafal grapples with obtaining precise calculations and building empirical theories. His greatest challenge, however, lies in conducting this research discreetly—lest he wish to meet the same fate as other heretics.

Yumiella Dolkness may be of noble descent, but her dark hair and rare dark-type magic—both associated with the Demon Lord—spark fear in anyone who sees her. When she is five years old, Yumiella regains memories of her previous life in modern Japan, also realizing that her fate is to become the hidden boss that appears after Alicia and her suitors defeat the Demon Lord.

Yumiella refuses to live as the game dictates and, as she prefers the game's fantasy elements over its romance, she decides to cultivate her magical skills and level up in secret. However, everything falls apart on the day of the Royal Academy's entrance ceremony. Yumiella's powers are measured at level 99—something thought impossible even for the royal knights, let alone a 15-year-old girl. With the royal family requesting her help, and everyone else insisting that she prove her strength, Yumiella realizes that her dream of a quiet life is no longer an option.

However, as Dariel lacks any magical potential, he is nothing but a disgrace in the eyes of Granbarza's son, Bashbarza, who fires Dariel right after assuming his father's position as a general.

Stripped of a home and a job, Dariel wanders the forests, where he stumbles upon a human girl named Malika running from a monster. After Dariel intervenes to help Malika, she invites him to stay at her village in return. There, he discovers that the reason he has zero suitability for magic as a demon is that he is, in fact, a human.

However, Dariel is no ordinary human. Possessing potential that far outweighs even heroes, Dariel may soon find himself involved in the humans and demons' seemingly never-ending conflict, facing against the race he once considered allies.

The tiny department, consisting of Takao and her sole resident Yuu ""Kotori"" Takanashi, treats complex cases that most other departments within the hospital cannot resolve on their own.

The mystery-obsessed Takao always tries to insert herself into cases that capture her fancy—much to the dismay of her colleagues and the police. Even if her meddling creates more problems for the hospital and those around her, none can deny the brilliance that the young department head exhibits as she weaves a diagnosis together. No matter the specialty, no case is impossible for Takao and a somewhat reluctant Takanashi to solve.

Having no say on the matter, Philia immediately goes to serve Parnacorta. As a foreigner, she presumes that she will not be treated much better than in Girtonia. Contrary to her expectations, Philia might have finally found a place with people worth smiling for.

Following the conclusion of the third Grail War, a US-based organization with magi distinct from the London-based Mage Association, used data from Fuyuki's Grail War to plan their own ritual. Seventy years later, they used the city of Snowfield as the Sacred Land for their own Grail War. However, they were unable to successfully replicate every aspect of the ritual, resulting in it acting only as an imitation that has lost the Saber class and allowed for the summoning of strange Servants due to the blurring of the definition of a ""hero.""

Faldeus, a US organization spy, has Rohngall sniped upon his arrival, despite knowing that Rohngall is a puppet. He declares that their Holy Grail War has been in development and is real, causing a commotion at the Clock Tower, and that he wishes to ""advertise"" the project to the Association.

With the era of the horse reaching its end, contestants are allowed to use any kind of vehicle they wish. Competitors will have to endure grueling conditions, traveling up to a hundred kilometers a day through uncharted wastelands. The Steel Ball Run is truly a one-of-a-kind event.

The youthful Johnny Joestar, a crippled former horse racer, has come to San Diego to watch the start of the race. There he encounters Gyro Zeppeli, a racer with two steel balls at his waist instead of a gun. Johnny witnesses Gyro using one of his steel balls to unleash a fantastical power, compelling a man to fire his gun at himself during a duel. In the midst of the action, Johnny happens to touch the steel ball and feels a power surging through his legs, allowing him to stand up for the first time in two years. Vowing to find the secret of the steel balls, Johnny decides to compete in the race, and so begins his bizarre adventure across America on the Steel Ball Run.

With power reclaimed from the influential Chancellor Buwei Lü, King Ying Zheng begins laying the groundwork for a new, unified legal state with the support of key allies like strategist Changping Jun and legalist Li Si.

As Qin launches a campaign to seize new territory from the state of Zhao, their advance is halted by the brilliant strategist, Li Mu. In response, Changping Jun devises a bold plan: to bypass Zhao's defenses and strike at the key city of Gyou, near Zhao's capital.

To carry out this risky maneuver, a powerful coalition army is formed—led by the tacticians Ou Sen (Wang Jian), Kan Ki (Huan Yi), and the warrior queen Yo Tan Wa (Yang Duanhe). Joining them are the next generation of Qin commanders: Xin's Fei Xin Force, Mou Ten (Meng Tian)'s Gaku Ka Unit, and Ou Hon (Wang Ben)'s Gyoku Hou Unit, each operating independently.

The fierce battle for Gyou begins, as the future of Qin's unification hangs in the balance.
